A1TUF99ZYUUZ3P,Perfect TiVo,"No problems -- ever.  Easy to use and easy to upgrade and/or add larger hard drives.I liked it so much I just bought another...the SVR-3000.Hopefully, Sony will continue to make DVRs with the latest technology."
A1V1KGN2CP02H1,Great Replacement 8mm Camera,"In 1992, I bought a Sony CCD FX-510 8mm stereo camcorder. By February 2000, we had worn the old camera out, after working around the world! If you want to keep playing 8mm tapes, you either have to replace your 8mm camcorder, or buy a 8mm deck. The camcorders are cheaper than a deck! I  bought the Sony CCD-TRV66 because it could play my stereo 8mm tapes from my  old camera. A digital Sony camcorder would do this, but at more $. The  best surprise was that playback on the new HI-8 camcorder seemed to deliver  higher resolution on the old Video 8 tapes. This might be due to the  filtering on the Hi-8 camcorder. The TRV-66 has image stabilization,  nightshot, Hi-8 resolution, stereo sound, lots of digital features and a  color flip out screen. All of this is still less than I paid in 1992  for the CCD FX-510. After 8 years, Sony  kept continuity on operational  features; the basic functions of their camcorders is the same. Kudos for  great design. I plan to wear out this camera, too!"
A3GG03BYD7YS1X,Outstanding.,"Ordered 2 of them for protection of my new Canon lenses.Reasonably priced, very prompt delivery. Excellent quality. US made.Perfect fit with camera lens and cap.Very satisfied with seller."
A6YH4KGUQX8HA,A toy,"I wanted something small and easy to use. Basically just keep track of my route while hiking in the woods so I could find my way back to the truck.This unit is slow, unreliable and has poor battery life.It's a neat toy if you are walking around in your yard.Save your money and buy a better model if you are really going to have to rely on it to find your way out of the woods.Oh, BTW, even the slightest canopy or cloud cover and you'll lose your signal."
A3QO78RD8LI7LP,A bit pricy for making two tapes,"After purchasing my digital video camera in late November of last year and creating exactly 2 video tapes, the camera stopped working and began generating an E01 error message.  After digging out my paperwork, I was dismayed to learn that the warranty covers a year in parts but only 90 days labor.  I brought the unit to JVC's recommended service center and was quoted a huge repair bill to re-align and overhaul the camera.  After buying the camera less than a year ago I just don't know if I can bring myself to spend the additional money to `make it actually work'.  If you have to buy this camera make sure you get the extended warranty."
A3KPC2CZV4F5R8,Nearly 25 Years Later,"I had a pair of these plugged into my Sony Discman back around 1990.  Somewhere along the way I lost or broke them, and since then, I've tried dozens and dozens of headphones, earbuds, closed ear, open ear, you name it.  I've spent as much as $350 on some pairs, and always in the back of my mind, I've scowled: ""I swear my Porta Pros were better.""Of course after 20+ years, I'd started to suspect my ears were just failing.  After all, what are the odds that not a single headphone I'd tried in the past two decades was better than the junk I had my mom drive me to the store to pick up, right?  Guess what?  It wasn't my ears.Yes -- you'll lose a few hairs in that odd headband, and it tends to collapse to its smallest size as soon as you take them off your head.  Some people will think you're trying to be a hipster by sporting 30 year old headphones.  Ignore them.  It will be easy.  Because with the PortaPros, you will hear nuances and details in music you've never heard before.  I can't recommend these enough."
A3889YNAGNL4VD,Versatile but fragile.,"This cigarette-pack sized radio has surprisingly clear sound. It is capable of getting a variety of TV and radio stations, very helpful when you want to listen to a TV show (news, for example). The fragility comes in if the unit is dropped or banged against a rigid surface. The first one I owned was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about 18 inches and it quit - permanently. Nothing I knew could resurrect it. But by that time I was hooked, so I saved and got another one! This one I have in a neoprene camera case for travel, and it has been dropped and still functions. Now, after not quite a year, the earbud jack is doing the fade-in fade-out, first-the-left-ear now-the-right-ear-goes-out routine. REALLY ANNOYING. But I still like this unit for its ability to get TV stations. Also, it is very light - when it hangs from my belt, it is hardly noticeable. I would buy it again but treat it with care."
A39ELA1OR7CN7O,Tamrac 5612 Pro Camera Bag,"I needed a camera bag that is light weight but able to hold all that I need when using a film 35mm  camera and a digital SLR. This bag if perfect. It will hold 2 35mm cameras(SLR digital) with lenses attached and additional lenses, flash,filters and gadgets. It has a special place designed for extra memory cards and a system to show which ones have been used.It has another special place for film.The best part is that it is very easy to get in and out of this bag when you  are out taking pictures."
A15TC4E8UVEYGJ,Watch out,"I just recently purchased a referbished item from cec-corp and the item malfunction in just a couple of days and i tried to gain information on returning the item but neither cec-corp or olympus would help me, so watch out for cec-corp"
A10STX704CY2IH,Perfect for storing those old cds/dvds!,"I had a very large collection of CDs and DVDs that were taking up so much space. I didn't want to toss them because I spent so much money on them. I found this and it works like a charm. I removed the CD/DVD sleeves from the plastic cases and put them into the sleeves in this book along with the CD/DVD. Everything is so organized now and I can see everything I own with the flip of a few pages. Love it, doesn't take up much space at all and is great quality!"
A406U7FW8XGGB,Great price ...mediocre picture,"In retrospect, I should've paid an extra hundred or so for quality. The pictures are ususally washed out or too dark. If you want to use flash, you will probably miss the photo opp because it takes so darned long for the flash to be ready.It is my first digital camera and I find this is pretty much a case of you get what you pay for. For (the price) you don't get much here. It'd make a good kid camera, though."
A30XHFZD87PIW3,where is it,I may be the only person writing a review who actually had this product.  The rest are reviewing the concept.  In concept this is great.  For the 10 hours this thing worked over the two weeks we had it it was great!Otherwise its been the green screen of death...wait up to 24 hours with nothing happening for it to try and correct itself everytime there is a problem.It simply did not work.  I am waiting for my replacement for another two weeks.  Notice that I am waiting.  The concept it great and I am hoping I just got a bum box!
A3OF7Z04QGMWQW,too small,"from reading reviews and product info, i had the impression that this pack would be big enough to handle two bodies and at least three lenses.  i quickly ran out of room ...this is what i carry in the main compartment : 5d with 24-70 2.8L attached; 70-200 2.8L IS;16-35 2.8L: and a few small accesseries : only 2 lense hoods and a 1.4 TC.  there is definetly not enough room for a second body (unless its a point and shoot -- my rebel with, say a 50 mm attached, or just body only will not fit), and so i have to carry my rebel xt in a second bag.  the idea was to have it all in one bag for conveniece sake.  i thought ""two bodies "" meant ""two bodies"" !? i had a upcomming trip andso kept the bag instead of returning it--other wise i would have spent some more time shopping around.  on the plus side it seems well built;  has enough pockets/pouches for all the other knick/knacks(batteries, charger, flashes,cf cards etc) ; the main compartment is well padded; its fairly comfortable to lug around on my back and (as long as your not carrying a tripod or mono) looks very descreet."
AZ1H3VLCDR298,Please read this review so you don't make the same mistake!,"When I bought this player I thought what the heck, what couldgo wrong with it. besides the mechanical problems, it is an inferiormachine. the eject button is right next to the stop button, so if your fingers slip a touch, you have to close the tray again and find where you left off in the movie, therefore another awful problem: it won't remember where you left off at! the booklet came apart in two days. it was half-#$!  attached by two staples. and if the machine is unplugged, you have to reprogam your remote for your television, because it'll forget the code! it started screwing up on the matrix and I took it in to exchange it, since I bought the extended warrenty. needless to say it is heading off to the shop, and thank god for the no-lemon policy! because I WILL keep sending it back 'till I get what I want.  when I was at the service desk, I saw a panasonic and a sony DVD player brought in around the same time. it's too late for me, but my advice to those who want a dvd now, please wait. it's a new technology and many things are wrong with it...if you must buy one, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER. the price may be attractive, but it is garbage. stick to the two best names: JVC and sony. i regret for not waiting longer and making a more intellegent decision. RESEARCH!  don't get information from the sales people, read magazines and go to independent websites for the best player.(i told them to test a bugs life on it to see if it would mess up!)"
A1QVKX2ZJIQSJA,Gets worse over time,"This player has been unbelivably frustrating.  When I first bought it, it played 100% of the DVD's.  Within 2 months it would only play 80% of the DVD's I put in it... and now 6 months later it only plays about 10% of the DVD's I put in it. Doesn't matter if it's a new DVD or old... it either won't load, won't eject, won't play, or keeps looping infinitly, or stutters stop/start/stop/start constantly.A total waste of my money... I won't be buying from Philips again"
A3ANRNLZ2LVM8J,No problems thus far!,"It works...has met my needs, bought primarily due to length, color and need to meet certain connection end points, as equipment I had was missing a power cord."
AFXVN6Y3KTNIK,"Pretty, functional, pricey","This is a sturdy and attractive surge protector. It's obviously well made, the colors look nice (I've gotten quite a few complements, which is funny, for a surge protector). It's kind of overpriced to be honest, but I liked my first one so much I bought a second one for the office a couple years later.Unlike some surge protectors I've had in the past, the sockets don't melt (scary, huh?) and plugs slide firmly in or out but are held with a firm grip."
A1DT7F0Z0GR235,A Cool Walkman!,this is a cool walkman with AM/FM/TV band. Too good for this price!!!
AWTTK1WBY9292,OK For Everyday,If I had it to do over again I would have bought a camera with a higher pixel count. This camera is great for everyday snapshots but falls short if you want to take sports or action pics. The flash takes forever to recharge and the delay for autoflash is just stupid slow. The digital zoom is pretty worthless since the pixel count is so low. A great deal if all you do is take the family snapshots at holidays.
A2S8SKA0B9DJAL,I've enjoyed it...,"I work for a private school as the official photographer.  We have two Olympus digital cameras--the E-10 and the E-20.  We were using a shoulder strap bag for the E-10, but when we bought the E-20, I decided to look for better bags for both of them.  A photo backpack seemed much more comfortable than a shoulder strap bag (which I can't stand).  Contrary to what people think, schools like the one I work at don't have a big stash of money sitting around, so I needed to find a relatively {inexpensive} bag and I ended up buying two of these bags.  I found them to be great, especially during the summer, when I took the camera on a couple camping and hiking trips.  When we went on hiking trips, I was responsible for a group of kids in the range of 10 to 12 years of age.  Naturally, they didn't bring enough water, but I was fortunate to be able to pack five small water bottles in the backpack along with the camera and an extra lens.  At one point I also had a small bag of trail mix.  Now, remember that I had a digital camera that required no film.  The camera is about the same size as a regular SLR camera, maybe a bit larger.  The only other accessories I had were some extra sets of batteries.  There a couple of zippered pouches that I used for this.  When I'm not going on these hiking trips, I've had plenty of room for the camera, two extra lenses (a telephoto and a wide-angle), a charger and a water bottle or two.  So unless you are planning on bringing a bunch of extra lenses, this is a great bag, especially for the price."
A1P5UMEPIEO06Q,Love it!,I work from home and use the headset much of the day. I like the option of having 2 different ways to wear it. I find the over-the-head style most comfortable. No complaints from anyone about not being able to hear me. The mute switch is a great feature. Have also used the volume adjustment. Have not had need to try the microphone adjustment yet.Absolutely no issues. Highly recommended.
A2IY18DK48MMFV,Great travel bag,"This bag is a great fit for my travel and day trips.  I use it for carrying a Pentax KD20, 2 zoom lens, and a few accessories.  I am able to fit a smaller water bottle in the pocket with the front tripod strap but its not 100% secure (You can pay an extra $25 for the water bottle adapter, but that's a bit pricy).  It is a small bag and perfect for day trips/hikes, etc...not so much for storing your entire collection of photography equipment in.  I am very happy with it and the quality is great.  The bag is very protective and the padding inside is all moveable so you can design the inside compartments to your own specifications.One improvement that could be made include ventilated padding on the back and straps so that sweat isn't trapped during a warm outing.  The straps are not bad but not nearly as comfortable as something like a camelbak.This dealer shipped the product very fast and included a surprise free gift - thank you for great service!"
A3O2PE34HV8Y4B,Awesome Headphones,"One of the better headsets Ive owned to date. I play HL games and this by far is the best one for voice communication yet! Very clear, and no background noise or static at all. Very comfortable and the sound quality is awesome. the only problem is that it is foldable so it fold on you whren trying to put it on from time to time, but otherwise, it geta A+s all around. And for less than $45, it is a great deal compared to other high quality mic headsets. And trust me, I spent a lot of money on other headsets, logitech and cyber acoustics (well CA was pretty good too, but too expensive for the good pair so this Plantronics if worth it), but no one is such a good pair for such a good price. Recommend for all gaming and/or internet calls/chatting!"
A2CSMLAEP0D4K5,Great case,"This is just what I needed to organize my DVD collection.  It is well-made, sturdy and seems durable.  Also, it is a great value for the price."
A2ZE7SG5A4VRRH,it works!,it works as intended and a great bang for your bucks! installed on my  epson power lite 710 hd projector!
A3RVAT0EUNM2MI,"Slightly damaged, but working perfectly","I got this cable to connect my laptop to the internet occasionally as the wi-fi is pretty bad.The wire didnt look or feel like new and out of the box.I saw that there were bends and it felt cheap.I was going to return it, but it gets the job done and has no loss of speed.So for the price there are not a lot of complaints."
A1R2FPZ1MJBK2B,engineering marvel with total ease of use,"I looked at a lot of digital cameras before I finally bought this one.  It seems a little pricey, but this little gem is an engineering marvel, and very well thought out to maximize the ease of use for all that power.  It can be used as a PhD Camera (Push here Dummy), or full on, do all your own settings or anywhere in between.  Customizable button. Fantastic zoom capability - so much you have to be careful of camera shake a full zoom.  I find the zoom really allows flexibility of shots, I always find I want to zoom in on a face, on wildlife or a special scene, and this camera can do it like no other - 38 to over 1000 zoom equivalent 35 mm.  Add black and white, sepia, or whiteboard capability.  Add 100 to 800 ASO settings, manual or automatic.  I found almost instantaneous download through my USB port.  I bought the card reader, but don't really need it.  I bought the 128 meg card, and its well worth buying more card space, 8 meg is not enough. All digitals tend to eat batteries, but Olympus cameras are among the most miserly of the current digitals. This camera uses batteries, but at an acceptable rate. It can use 2 lithium packs or 4 AA's - recharagble or alkaline - so you can always find power in a pinch. Automatic white adjust for true colors whether you are outdoors, indoors with tungsten or flourescent lighting.  Professional quality 4 x 6 prints, very acceptable 8 x 10. How big do you need? All for 10 trim ounces of weight!  Take it anywhere. What are you waiting for?  If you have the $ you will have a blast with this camera. The only drawbacks I found are the blue halo on bright white edges - but I think all current digitals have that - and this darn camera is smarter than I am."
A3SOLBOIBNYCCP,Good deal for a reasonable price,Bought this for Nikon D40 and its a perfect fit. Comfortably holds the D40 and its kits lens with the Nikon strap inside. Holds the SD card in the inside pouch and the spare battery in the outside pouch.Cant hold the charger and its cord though. But with a spare battery and with Nikon's efficiency you dont have to charge quite often so its not a great minus.
A1XE7EVXY9VJFO,Unbeatable value,"OK. I read some of these reviews, and bought the kit. And they are great.  If you follow the instructions, the sound quality is very impressive. Do put the woofer on the floor, with the wall behind it.  Do adjust the PC sound to about 70% of full volume, then adjust the CSW volume level (this stops most of the hissing and clicking). The build quality is astounding for equipment at this price level.  They haven't skimped on cable length, the pots (volume controls) are smooth, the power supply is well up to the job, the satellite speakers don't slide around on the desk.  Top design, top construction, top quality sound (ok, Golden-ears - you can get better - but need to spend LOADS more to do so). If you actually like music, and listen to it on your computer, don't settle for anything less.  One unusual observation: the cat was quite puzzled by the subwoofer, and spent half an hour listening to it from a distance of about 10mm.  She must have been a headbanger in a previous life."
A34FNK95CZXDXK,Cable works great,"This cable works flawlessly, plus the price is really low. I can't think of anything which could be improved. Recommend!"
A1FV05L6G193PI,perfect size steamer,"Perfect size for single serving (or 2 max), 1 pot can be used for 2 different ways of cooking.  And its healthy to eat steam vegetable.  Great buy."
AQQVPOL6VPVVN,Info,"The actual dimnetions of this product are 7"" long and 7"" wide ( at the end of the product- the part that we hold to our eyes is not quite as wide and fit to the eyes.These are VERY strong binoculars, they are 16x the magnification, the 50 ( the other #) is simply the size of the front lens.. its 50 mm in diameter ( wide)... they are very strong and you can see things very far away. If you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something, then I believe these would be way to powerful and large. ( also I read somewhere, and I think its true that anything over 10x the magnification ( these are 16x) that you should use a tripod, since its too hard to see properly, since it needs to be completely still."
A22U5XH5Z3CX9A,Great in concept but...,"...I've had many problems with the Nomad II MG. When it's working it's great, the only problem is I've had numerous problems with it. Having a problem or two isn't so bad as long as there's good support behind it. On this front, Creative Labs has REALLY dropped the ball. Their support is literally nonexistant. Go to their website ([...]) and you'll see what I mean. The site is extremely confusing to navigate and when you finally get to the right support area there isn't much information there. You've got to really try just to find out where to send an email to ask a question. The FAQs are useless. Their knowledgebase is also useless although I don't hold this against them, I've yet to see a useful knowledgebase. As far as the problems I've encountered I'll list them here: 1. Software for the Mac is horrible. Ok, not a &quot;problem,&quot; but it is. They give you SoundJam but, of course, it's not a FULL version and everytime you open the software it asks you if you'd like to buy the full version. This is EXTREMELY annoying. Add to this the software isn't all that good and it gets worse. 2. I purchased a 128MB card to allow me to listen to more songs. I've yet to get the card to work in the player. I've installed the upgrade on the player that supposedly allows it to recognize that much RAM but it just locks the player up. Not sure what's happening with this one. 3. My most recent problem is the player just doesn't work now. It won't turn on, it won't charge, nothing. I've tried resetting it and I can't even do that! I have a non-functional player right now and I'm still awaiting a reply from their tech support. All in all, I couldn't tell someone to buy this product. It looks great on paper and sounds great when it's working but there seem to be too many problems. When you have a problem it's a pain to get an answer. The Rickster"
A54JBUO30K3FA,He wonders what he did before the winder...,"Actually, he remembers quite clearly what a hassle it was without it!  I would say he is thrilled with it.  It was at the top of my husband's Christmas list, so how could I not buy it?!  He's glad I did!"
A3MVGT4QXBBZR8,Great - buy only original,"I used the original battery that came with my camera for 5 years. Eventually it used to die after 5-6 pictures...This one is Canon original, I was able to use it on five different occasions and take dozens of photos before charging again. And 5 minutes of charging gave it lots of juice. HIGHLY recommended. Worth the high price, and you probably won't find it cheaper then Amazon."
AE9Q83U8XASTR,Best thing since sliced bread,"I had an SMC cable router since we had DSL installed in NOV 2001.  Lots of problems the whole time - although manually resetting the SMC always fixed the probs.  Just bought the Linksys last week - Wow - this is a fantastic router!.  I updated the firmware from APR 2002 to DEC 2002 - but it had worked fine before.  I'm in a four-story concrete (German) house, the router is in the stairwell on 2nd floor - and we have great signal strength/link on the three top floors.  My Dell notebook, with a Linksys PCMCIA card, works in the basement but signal/link are around 40%.  Either wired or wireless - this is a great router."
A2UM70SXX6TY30,I suggest you skip this and upgrade immediately,"As soon as you start using this wonderful little gizmo, you are going to want to be able to download Mapsource maps into the system for greater detail than the basemap that comes with it. So just go ahead and spring for the eTrex Legend right off the bat. I have found that when buying things like electronics, binoculars, etc. it's better to spend the maximum first. The reason I say this is that in the end you will spend less money. The Legend has 8MB of memory and it can take quite a lot of extra maps into its memory. So why not do that first?Otherwise, these little GPS units are the most wonderful things to own. They are incredibly helpful. I took my Legend to Florida with me and it saved me at least half-a-dozen times from making wrong turns that would have put me miles from my goal. When you go to an unfamiliar area, all &quot;sense of direction&quot; generally goes out the window. But if you have one of these...no problem."
ATLX650HUQN1U,ePods to the rescue!!!!!!!!!,"I have been searching for a device like this for some time now. The Palm is great but serves as merely an organizer. The websurfing on my Palm 7 is minimal and I can't stand the text-based experience. Although the ePods product is tethered to the wall, the ability to surf the web from any room in my home is remarkable. I never thought I'd be able to browse my recipes from my kitchen.......even while cutting carrots. In a nutshell, this is a must buy!"
AUK8ZOU93975S,Great start up system,"I like it very much, actually got the black set, good quality sound set up is a breeze, using it with a media center PC and audigy sound card.price was great. I did not wanted to out do my home stereo, but now my PC sounds better thant than it.It was a grat buy"
A3M2GOIB3HIXZD,"Best ergonomics and feel, but occasionally not recognized","I'm a big guy with large hands- =this is the best mouse I have ever had=, in terms of ergonomics, feel, button response and crisp scroll wheel action. I love it... and the blue lighted scroll button tells me when the computer recognizes it.. which is the rest of the story, sometimes I found the host computer not recognizing the mouse on a re/ start, and have to start more than once with the mouse plugged into the USB port- on three computers with Windows XP I have tried it on. (Merely re-plugging the mouse resulted in no action at all- ""Plug and Pray"" was not enough.) If not for this nuisance, I'd rate this ""IBM"" branded mouse five stars. (N.B. As the illustration shows, it would likely be grossly uncomfortable for a left-hander, however.)"
A1FI67P2E7GMQ5,Garmin Carry Case,"I'm glad that I bought the carry case with my Garmin eTrex, because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry.  I haven't used the belt clip yet, but I liked that option."
AOOU4GVVQHK5O,Linksys has a winner,This is a great product - 10 minutes to set up and it works perfectly. A real winner.
AKL5X3FCZFZGH,Vivitar 35mm from M Z Photo,Order for (hard to find) 35 mm skide projector was filled FAST and at a very reasonable price!  Projector works pefectly.  I will definitely use Mr Tuli and M Z Photo again !
AXKEY9PZR8OH,great,"A UV lens is a must, you need to protect your gear, Great add-on to the lens and great price!"
A2HEFRNTI8S83H,Small but capable,"This backpack is a lot smaller than I expected... granted, I did not take the time to actually think about the measurements.  Also I think the straps of the backpack are very uncomfortable.  It's probably good for anyone who is not thinking of professional work... but I am already thinking about what I want in my next backpack."
A18ZFJKE7DOW1Y,Works Great and Very Reasonable,"These have great sound and even come with several very handy adapters. The price is great, too. I can highly recommend these if you are looking for a good general-purpose headset/cord!"
A12Z6VEOKIJN01,Keyboard,"This keyboard is just what i have been looking for, it works great and it is what i am used too.I am very pleased and it got here fast, thanks."
A3LIRYLQRA4QAI,a great add on for the pc decorator in us all,"it looks great, bright but no overly so. placed mine in between the feet of my pc for to light up the bottom of my tower. Looking to get another for the other side of the case. Recommended."
A2UN3PBHUJY42O,Excellent Replacement for IPOD earbuds,"I wanted to replace the IPOD-included earbuds because they didn't stay in my ears and I wondered about the sound quality.  The Sennheisers met all of my expectations.  They stay in well, even during exercise, and the sonic quality is very good.  I would buy them again and recommend them to others; and the price is right."
A1BRON25PLUZDF,"Great, but","This recorder is everything that all the reviewers say it is with one big exception.  The new digital audio for Dolby Digital 5.1 sound does not work at this time.  I hooked up my new DSR6000 to my system and plugged it into my Yamaha DSP-A1 (which is hooked up to eight speakers) for total surround sound and got intermittent sound.  After a few hours of trying to correct the problem, I decided I had a bad unit and returned it for another one.  Guess what?  The same thing with the new second unit. Now a call to TiVo was in order.  First of all, I must say they were right up front about the problem, stating that the software fix for this was about three months away.  Well, the reason I waited so long to buy this unit was because originally it could not record in digital sound.  So it was quite a bummer when I found out it didn't work and would have to wait months to have the problem addressed.  I think some of the editorial reviews should have done a little more research when they discussed how nice it was to have digital audio.  Also, you can't leave the optical audio cable attached or the intermittent sound will continue.  You are obliged to hope that the company can and will fix the problem expeditiously.  I also suggested (to no avail, so far), that they send mail to their customers addressing this problem."
A1F84V74TDHMIQ,Love this Lens!!,This is an awesome lens! and so compact. The quality is just great and the price is so reasonable...absolutely no problems here! I highly recommend this lens!
A7PCKDIMR859P,Easy to use,"This is my second pair, lost the first ones and was devastated. Bought two other pairs, couldn't compare with the Rocker focus ease of use!  So happy to find this pair!"
A1A6V6J32BZBSF,Perfect substitute for an older LPT:1 cable on an older model HP LaserJet,"I have an older model HP, a 4050n, that I have had for years and years. For anyone that has an older HP, we these were the workhorses of the industry and were more dependable than anything HP is producing now. Not being inherently wireless, I hooked it up to a Netgear print server using this cable and now it servers as a wireless workhorse."
A1YAGB6JNKKLLD,Good,"This is a great sounding cd player but, like most people, I have to say that the changer is very slow.  Other than that, a great player."
A17RBVZX3VTNBW,So simple,"A company I work for purchased this router so that I could share my DSL connection with the three computers (2 PCs and 1 Mac) in my home network. Setup took less than 5 minutes, and everything so far has worked perfectly. All three computers now have instant net access. In fact, the setup and operation are so simple I really don't have that much more to say :)"
A1D17NYG09RJIH,good for the money,"It has a sharp lens and lots of advanced features (&quot;B&quot; shutter speed, slow-synch flash, etc.) for the entry-level price.  I've always lugged around an SLR with extra lenses, but this summer I got one of these for my daughter before we went to Washington, DC. I ended up using the EZY-R more than my big Nikon -- and the photos I took (mostly daylight scenics and family snapshots) came out just as good as the Nikon's.  It does have the same limitations as any [similar] camera, but I think it's a good product if you know those limitations."
A1USLMR4BJ1RH0,Happy with the product,Fits easily onto my glass. I usually leave it on. The reason is I can clean my finger impressions and dirt easily without touching the lens. I have not checked how much it affects the pictures - have just followed what the experts say about it's use. Long time users say these products are long-lasting so I expect it to be like that.
A3SVXZ69IA4AVP,Does not work with NT 4.0,I tried this product with NT 4.0 and it does not work.  It claims to have conflicting interuppts when there are none.
A1MXJJ5F31BZ4T,Fine cable--good price,"Can't beat the price. All that's needed for long extensions.I've got 3 hooked together. This can create intermittent data sending problems, but not often."

APCUI22CRPL7F,Lens Filter,Really protect the lense. I enjoyed it not interfere with the use of my on board flash. I do event photography and some times the lens gets bumped.
A1RZ77T1M1VTAG,verizon novatel mifi 4510L,Works great I love it. At first I was doutful but then When I used it I fell in love with it.
A1EWPEGJYIX23N,"Mount for a 32"" flat screen TV",No issues or problems. took me about 10 minutes to install it and it looks great on the wall! Less furniture in the bedroom now that the tv is on the wall!
A1F18K8S6MFJA7,cleaner,Once you are out of fluid you must buy more. Fluid doe s not last very long. With the sad shape of VHS blank tapes you need something. Soon as I transfer my VHS tapes to disc I will go with re right able disc to record and re record stuff.
A24K0N5C06092B,Great for Road Warriors,"This gave good performance, primarily because of the the SCSI factor. You need more RAM (possibly 128MB), to prevent Buffer Overflow. I highly recommend this product for Road Warriors, who need to make backup, or play  MP3s."
A17WNPIL2DR6W9,Short-stemmed Microphone Is Frustrating to Use,"I am disappointed in this product's performance because I cannot easily use the microphone to modulate my speaking voice. While the microphone's stem is flexible, it is too short to be positioned optimally. As a result, the microphone remains somewhere to the left of my speaking voice. Some callers have told me that my voice seems &quot;far away.&quot; When I bend the stem to get closer to the microphone, the arm is long enough to catch one side of my mouth but too short to be positioned an inch or so directly in front of me. I often resort to switching from the headset to the handheld telephone midway through a conversation."
A1YQHCV0CKASR1,Buy a Palm,"I read mixed reviews on the ebookman.  I should have listened.  I'm sorry, but this thing is a piece of junk.  I have a Palm M500 too, and it is GREAT!  The ebook reader in the Palm system is much better, IMO.  The ebookman will conk out for no reason, and then you have to reload everything.  Batteries go dead, reload everything.  It would make a great paperweight.  Buy a Palm, be happy."
A1NT7XBENWRANO,Very VERY solid purchase.  Unless you have small hands.,"Really like this product.  I have had NO trouble getting all of the functions to work properly.  There's a trick to it though.  READ THE BLOODY DIRECTIONS.  Yeah, I know it's a book, and sure it's thick, but there's about fifteen pages of actual directions in about thirty languages, so just suck it up already, complainers.  Sorry for the rant.  I was worried that this watch would be tough to get functioning from other reviews.  Not so.  It's pretty big, but light weight and sturdy.  Gtting used to the novel second hand takes a few days, but as I'm in the vet-medical bizz, I use this watch in anesthesia to time recordings, and every day without worrying about some critter scratching the face or something.  Good stuff.  I'd say for the price it'd be tough to do better."
A29MTG92ZROZVS,"it work ,what more can I say !?",never had a problem using it with my palm Tungsten T!work great.
A29945GY3TG630,LOVE IT! tons of cool features...,"...This is a really great camera to say the least. It was pretty easy for me to figure out how to use it after playing with it for an hour. I love that it can shoot in both color and black & white. It can also take QuickTime movies. It works with both Smart Media and Compact Flash cards. If you have a 128 mb card and use the cam in a the lowest resolution, it can take almost 1,500 photos!! Pictures are high-quality (crisp and detailed). Colors are vibrant and true. Works EXCELLENT in low-light conditions. There are tons of other things and settings to play with and you can even program your favorite settings into it. It has Telephoto, macro mode, and image-stabalization. One feature that I found particularly useful is the tiny remote. Just put the cam on a tripod, (press a button & a red light shows you exactly where to stand), get in position and take your self photos. I absolutly LOVE this camera! FYI, this camera is somewhat heavy, not a big deal if it doesn't bother you. I recomend getting a good sturdy tripod. The camera also comes with very high-quality batteries. None of the rechargables I bought lasted nearly as long, but I would recommend getting at least 2 spare sets of rechargables for when you're ""out and about"". An ac-adapter would be a good investment if you plan on using the camera for extended periods of time indoors. Oh, it also comes with Adobe Photoshop 5 LE. The other software that comes with the camera is ""ok"", I didn't really need it since my preffered method of downloading photos is with a card reader.Hope this helps!"
A95A9XOSHTQKX,Cat5E  50 foot cable,"This 50ft CAT5e cable works fine in my home theater setup (Viera Cast streaming).  It's flexible enough to wind around various corners of living room.  Seems well made.  Price was right, shipped quickly with Amazon Prime.  It's not Cat6 but who cares.  Most people aren't even using the full 100baseT throughput let alone Gigabit.  Cat5e should support Gigabit Ethernet anyway.  For my purposes this works, I am happy.UPDATE:  This cable is still working fine for my living room receiver and blu-ray network connection.  NOTE:  Just an FYI, the price on this fluctuates at times.  I paid $5.52 for the 14foot length cord in January 2012, currently (Nov 24th, 2012) it's $6.64"
A334K5BUESGEDU,Great Headphones for Gaming!,"I read a lot of reviews for gaming headphones. It was confusing picking the right one. Then I read the reviews on the Sony MDRV6. This no nonsense headphones was just what I needed. The headphones do not have active noise canceling, but they fit around your ears and you can hear the drop in noise volume while wearing them. I needed a pair for long gaming sessions and these satisfy that requirement at a much lesser price than those other &#34;gaming&#34; headphones.My only negative would be that the headphones fit a bit too snugly that after so many hours of wearing them, my ears begin to ache just a bit, but maybe that would happen when wearing any headphones for so many hours! Get these headphones, you will be pleased with your purchase!"
A1D3ROD5UF078O,good for the price,"I needed a couple new cd cases while updating my music collection. There isn't a whole lot out there and these seem good for their price. Like other reviewers have said: the carrying handle is very close to the case - so its hard to actually use, but not a bother for me. Also, it is a little bit hard to zip up back up due to design, but not too big of a deal. At first, it does seem like the binding is a bit flimsy because of the plastic ring holding the pages together, but so far it has been okay and the pages turn smoothly. After only having the cases for a month or two - I cannot rate on their long term durability. Case logic has held up well in the past though."
AMQ2BMT57ZKEW,These are just Awesome,I just got my Headphones. These are far better than the one I got for Ipod. I would strongly recommend folks.
A1UOTFEH8Z7QWH,It does what it says it does!,Easy access for all my Games. Thats what I use it for mainly. Does not scratch them or anything. Very happy with this product and if I need another then I know where I'm going.
A2QMPB2I0Z5K6W,well built and a good buy,If you need extra ports for you network these work great and are ruggedly built. The metal case should take a beating and aid in cooling.
A1BRQSOC8VW9W8,Very quick shipping!!!!!!,"Ordered on Aug 15th and received on Aug 21th. Very fast shipping to FPO address. Usually, the quickest is 2 weeks and of course, up to 2 months. Anyhow, I'm not a pro photographer or do I have to have the money to spend 100-200$ on a filter. I bought it just to protect my lenses and it does a good job. I'm still shocked how quick I received the products. To a point when the guy from the post office told me I got some camera stuffs in the mail, I did not believe him. I actually bought a 77mm, 72mm, 62mm and 58mm all together. Why buy 3 and pay for shipping when I can add the forth filter and get free shipping. I will buy from this seller again."
A22MY6UMUQTOGG,Close but no cigar.,"Recently purchased a Garmin Talking Street Pilot III Colormap.  The lighter adapter included with it has an integral speaker which I find to be quite satisfactory and very helpful when driving.  You will no longer have to watch the GPS screen, as Ms. G gives you voice prompts (as long as you use the auto routing feature) when you need to make a turn, etc.  If you need an adapter, get the model with the speaker!"
A2OD0GJGVMA07I,Met our needs well,"We're dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to (and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system)  This little gem combines a single cd with cassette.  I like the auto repeat function.  The size and price and combo unit had great appeal.  Never used the remote, so don't know.  Easy to ""install"" and use right away - no complex hookup needed.  I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit."
A186VVOJBAHFJ1,"Plugged In, Worked Without a Hitch","Downloaded the XP driver first.  Inserted the card.  It worked, and works great.  Can't relate to all the bad reviews.  It was so simple, and hasn't failed or locked-up even once.  Using a Compaq 2715US, PIII 1.13 Ghz, WinXP Home.I'm really pleased to have the internet available all over the house."
A33V1XSMHLXO2H,DON:T BUY THIS!!!!!!!,"This CD player is nothing but a pieace of junk. I've had mine for about a year and and the skip protection is not that great. And if you plan on using it in the winter outside (I like to listen to music walking to class, i am in college) then this one won;t help. If it is even RWEMOTELY cool outside it will shut off on it's own all the time making it impossible to listen to anything. Now...I dunno, but CD players are not supposed to do that...especially a portable one ment to be carried around. DO NOT BUY THIS! It's a waste of money!!!!!!!!"
A2YW90U088SMQB,Worth the cost,"I did not rate this five stars because the flat male plug is on 45 degrees. That's fine if the electrical receptacle is left of where it is intended to be used but if the receptacle is to the right, cord will go off in the wrong direction till you can double it back. Also would be nice if it came in optional white or beige. The heavy black cord doesn't look good in our living room."
A1BY4RQLKIQVLS,Sanus TV Turntable,"This product does exactly what it's supposed to do.  I can easily swivel my tv around with one finger, and it doesn't damage the tabletop (don't forget to stick the rubber tips that come with the turntable on the bottom).  Yes, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
A2Z3V9XOQTCZM0,A must have accessory.........but..........,"This is a wonderful accessory to your 49g, and I have benefitted immensely from the cable.  But, I purchased the cable by itself...  It goes without saying that the large breadth of additional programs, and the ability to contiuously update the ROM are features that you almost can't live without, but there is no sense in living without some of your hard earned cash.  The cable can be purchased stand-alone from several on-line vendors. ...I purchased anadditional USB port adapter for this cable.  I rate the product itself very, very highly, but I rate the price for the unneccessary software you are being charged for as low as possible.  Good Luck!!!"
A23KMKQ0EN18BB,Does not support VOX,"I should have realized that this mic does not support VOX. I guess when you buy a microphone its can be either PTT (push to talk) or VOX.I'll have to return this and get a VOX enabled one, though I'm not sure which one at this point."
ABK0Z7HJN0AWV,This product worked great!,"I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable cable switch.In fairness, I only used it a couple of times for a class, so I can't recommendit for a long term use.M. Osterman"
AX5QFUIP579EH,Knook Simple Touch,Great basic little reader for the money. Battery life is great. Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she really likes it. performs as described and delivery time was as noted by seller.
A2EGCN45BFW5RZ,:-),"Quick & FastWorked 100%Cheap, Good, and FastProgramming the printer didn't take more than a few minutes and the cable Perfecto :-)"
A15QOBZOL5SQ9D,Well made,Works as a linear polarizing filter should. I'll need to get myself a couple more to fit my other lenses.
A2GNPHQFF0RWCV,Adding another 5-star to the 123 Reviews....,"What really else can I say about this legendary Canon lens that's not been said before?Well here's my thoughts anyway...Context: I'm a portrait/wedding photographer that likes to moonlight as a bird-tographer. Body this lens goes on - 30d, 5d, 7d, 5d3, 1ds2.What's Hot:- Price. I think this is a really well priced L lens. Canon seems to like charging an arm and a leg for that sliver of red paint.- For an L lens, this isn't that bad. Considering it is f2.0! Look at the glass in it!- Fast AF. Fastest AF-ing lens I've ever used. Ever. Period. From MFD to Infinity, this thing rips. You think it, it nails it. I wish I can attach it onto the old EOS 3 with eye-controlled focusing system.- Quiet USM motor. What else to say. Very useable in quiet church ceremonies.- Images. Ridiculously lovely. It is magic on full-frame cameras. I am always blown away by the images from this lens. I don't understand. It obliterates the background and does it without having any fancy 20 circular variable angle blades. Just good old fashion awesome images.- Sharp. I seldom stop down. It's always @f2.0 for me. Images are tack sharp. Atleast for my copy.- Colour. Pop. Pop. Pop.- It is also light. I have shot with 70-200 F4, F2.8L IS... those white zooms. And I can tell you it gets tiring after awhile. I've since switched to using the 135L as my ""long range"" lens at church ceremonies. Haven't look back ever since.What's Cold:- Big hood. One of the things I like about this lens is the size, it is not obnoxiously large as my old white zooms. However the hood seems to extend another 30-40% of the size. =(- Lack of IS. Sometimes it is nice to have... especially when paired with a cropper.I found out many folks are not very confident with the 135mm range. Preferring an 85mm or even at most a 100mm. Perhaps it is valid as 135mm can be quite close. What with the ability to crop thanks to our large megapickels cameras these days. But there's something really special at this range with this large of an aperture. My principle is to circulate out any lenses that are not or see little use within 12-24months. I've had this lens for a while now. This lens will be one of my mainstays for sure."
A2WU8BWNKQ0EM9,Grainy!,"I used this camera while snorkeling in Turks and Caicos.  Next time I'll buy waterproof housing for one of my digital cameras.  These are horribly grainy.  All the tricks I've tried to remove the grain leaves a very soft image.  All the glorious details of the reef are lost.  The only good images are those take above water or right at the surface, but they still have a vintage toy camera look, which is fine if you want ethereal, impressionistic images.  Don't buy this thinking you'll capture the wonder of a coral reef."
AK7RFQXIVJO11,"Put together correctly, but won't stay together",I have several different types of these and expected more from Monster brand.  They come apart if the cable is tugged at all.  Most other brands are both cheaper and better.
A20JYIHL1W1U54,Satisfactory VCR Picture from TOSHIBA,"This unit has excellent picture reproduction. This is one of the best VCRs I have seen within the past year. I made recordings and played them back and also played back pre-recorded tapes with good results as stated. I don't see what all the fuss is about the remote. The small buttons are ideal so large fingertips do not get in the way! That is good ergonomics. Time recording was a bit confusing I'll have to admit. The unit also is rather lightweight which made me concerned about the size and durability of the motor. However, the picture looks good in any event."
A1UV3PNF5TXAG6,"&quot;High Resolution&quot;, not likely!","If you're looking for a product to do anything margianally serious with, this is not for you.  The highest capture size that is not distorted is 320  x 240...  It's just not worth the time or money at this resolution..."
A1ISLNCWHLXNPU,Cobra handheld CB radio,Great sturdy product if you are going to be in a caravan and want to communicate with people a few car lengths away! You do NOT GET any where near the TWO- Four mile range that the product discriptions suggest. I actually tested the product numerous times and did not even get close to a 1.25 mile reception from the home base. I used this product to communicate with four other people on a jeep four wheel (off road park) trip. It worked very well for that purpose.
A3F5EHTWHLD3V1,Works great. ..,Purchase this DVD CD combo because I ordered a computer that was a student computer which didn't have a DVD player built in. . worked wonderfully
AOBGKBBDODKIP,I used it once and it worked,"I bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive. I plugged the USB drive into a Windows 7 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized.  This was a one-off transfer, it worked and I won't use it again. Dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage. God love anyone still using floppies...they have the patience of a saint. File transfers are slow because of the old technology, not the drive. The 4th star was for the easy plug and play, otherwise my rating is a neutral 3."
A3OW2ABRZ9HPTZ,Great little toy with a few drawbacks,All in all this is a great player. The worst thing about it is the headphones. I guess I have small ears because they don't even fit inside. My husband said he wore them for one hour and they hurt his ears so bad he threw them out. We had to run out and purchase a better headset. Also...the FM tuner is a separate entity that attaches by a cord to the player. Don't be fooled by the size because now you have to have 2 things clipped to your belt. That was a big disappointment. It never said that anywhere!
A1M0BV1O63MRD2,"Excellent, but Nikon CoolPix 950 still beats it...","It's great to see Olympus finally catching up to the pack. I own a Nikon CoolPix 950 also, and this is ALMOST as good (although about 1.5 times as expensive). I was a bit disappointed that even with the somewhat bulky lens  you only get 3x optical zoom without an attachment - the Nikon matches this  without the bulk, and digital zoom is for the birds. Still, all in all four  stars is four stars. Enjoy!"
A1MJ4WTOYW9WXZ,I love them! When they work...,"These don't stop working when I sweat, which all of my other ones would do. love the handy case and the sound is good. I bought another pair I liked them so much.edited on 1-8-12. left earbud stopped working."
A35HQHWKDP8FNU,Definite design flaw; Over heats and an internal fan does seem to resolve the issue.,"To Dr. Johnny Fever: Just an FYI: Read your review and had reply. I have a Marantz DR6050 which basically is a Philips CDR775 with some dressing on the top. The Marantz has the same freezing issue but is actually worse because it has less cooling holes in the cover and is .5 inches shorter. Back 10+ years ago I put a CDR 775 power supply and CDR (Recorder side recorder) in the Marantz and it worked for a while before finally giving me the old freeze up problem again. I did this because Marantz was no help in fixing, replacing or giving advice on the problem and I didn't want to spend a lot or money trying to fix. I am glad I didn't after reading all these bad reviews. I didn&#8217;t know about these reviews. I wrote up a nasty review on Marantz and the DR6050 many years. I knew there was a temperature problem because with the cover off and a fan blowing on it, it worked fine. A few days ago, I dusted of the Marants DR6050 from the basement and decided to put a 12 volt cooling fan in the unit. I troubleshot on the board and discovered the problem was in the center around the 3 chip cluster. I found a 12 volt source on the power board to connect to the fan so I didn't have to run a separate power cable into the unit. I added some air holes to the metal casing that hold the cdr board. (You need to be careful not to get metal onto the CDR. Now the unit is working great. When it died originally, I thought there may have been just a problem with my unit or possible a bad design flaw but after seeing the exact problem occur again, I knew it was a design flaw. I am shocked that Philips nor Marantz didn't fess up to this problem and correct this for their loyal customers. Over the years, Marantz has produced high end products that last for years. Not sure what happened here? I still have a 200 watt amp that I bought in 1986 that still works 100 percent. I guess we can live with a flop once in a while but I am very concern with not getting support. I haven&#8217;t bought any Marantz or Philips products since 2001 when I bought this."
A3016LUKEFF2NJ,"really a nice product- great price, even better performace","I have been installing wireless products for some time now.  I can honestly say that this wireless adapter is the best performer I have come across.The range and speed on this unit is very impressive compared to some of the other cards I have had experience with.  This card combines the best of all worlds:  Price, performace, and most importantly (at least to me), ease of use.I would highly recommend this unit to both the home and professional user.  Very slick card."
A1KXKOJOC8EWMW,"If it breaks, you're SCREWED","You'd think a HP CD-Writer with an HP Omnibook would work, right? It did...for two months. Then it stopped. Despite the fact that it was obviously broken (would not work after reinstall, or on a friend's computer; I tested the USB cables and my USB port separately, I tried it on a fresh install on a clean system), I went through three weeks of inane support e-mails (is the unit plugged in?). Once I had tried all 32 suggestions of theirs, they asked me for information to get it sent in for repair -- and THEN told me that they wouldn't do it in Canada. I'm now running over $15 in long-distance bills because they don't have a 1-800 support number and routine hold time is 45 minutes. This has been the worst experience in over fifteen years of dealing with computers. Avoid HP like the plague."
A32E3ZV3JJSTE1,Handy...,"I've found it to be handy and at a good price, but like other reviewers I had some problems. Ports tend to go bad and sometimes the unit dies. I was able to get warranty replacements and the new ones havent had problems yet."
A2ES11VSULHFLJ,Easy as ABC,"This is a great GPS for the person just getting their hands on one. It has few ""bells and whistles"" , just the basics, but gets good support from Garmin. The reception will be lost in deep forest cover (that's why you carry that compass too)but knowing this up front you can adjust line of travel. You will get a full day on a set of batteries (AA). I use a solar charger on extended trips to avoid hauling a crate of batteries. The accessories available allows for mounting on bicycle handlebars and windshield of an automobile."
A3QVAJAWKZY4SV,Great Camera and kit,"I talked my wife into letting me buy my own Christmas present and after much deliberation I finally decided on this Camera and kit.  She now wishes that she had found something else for me.  I can't go anywhere without taking along my camera!  With this kit you get the better lens (over the 28-80mm) than the normal Eos Rebel Kits, the quartz date and all the extras things that everyone needs anyway- so why not get them all together at once.  The camera gives me the ability to be as creative as I want, but can also be so simple that I can give it to my wife to use as a point and shoot.  I have used it for both color photographs and black and white, night and day, action and stills shots.  All the photos have turned out great!  I would highly recommend the camera for anyone who is buying an SLR for the first time or for someone who has used many before- it's an all around great camera!"
A1PMNIX1HS8XEI,Make sure it's compatible with your operating system,"I have a lot of respect for D-Link products, but this particular one (model DSB-P36) can throw you a curve.  There are two possible chips inside the connector, and two different drivers.  One works with XP and one doesn't.  If you look at the support site... they have a table that shows you the differences and how to tell if you have the right one.  Read it before buying, or you may wind up returning it."
A3RVKNFE17IUJT,Decent Cheap headphones,"If your ear buds are constantly falling out, then this is a good option for you. If you are expecting high quality sound from these cheap head phones, then buy something else.A decent pair of headphones to use while exercising.Cons:Headphone adapter fits loosely into the headphone jack.Sound quality is mediocrePros:A good value for the price."
ACRWKOL0WAT8M,Bargain!,"Excellent sound for this price.  Not the best,  but I got it for $4.  including shipping.  This is really what Chinese headphones should sell for anyway,  but don't.  Remember,  even at this price they're still making profits or they wouldn't sell them."
A1PU4EQWZB8P2T,Not for XP,"Simply put, this card is not for XP users.I followed the included directions and installed the card drivers and the included configuration software. The installer did not work correctly, and would skip the interface where I chose between &quot;infrastructure&quot; and &quot;ad-hoc&quot; modes. After I installed this software and the drivers, the card would not work. It would lose the connection every 5 seconds. I could not change the network name (I am using the Linksys 4 port wifi router which I bought at the same time), and the configuration software could not find any networks automatically.I downloaded the appropriate software and drivers from Linksys just to be sure I had the latest ones. After about an hour of de-installing and reinstalling the software and drivers, I finally installed JUST the drivers.Well, now the card works, but I can't use any of the XP built in features to find networks, etc. For some reason this card leaves most of the palettes greyed out (disabled). So this card is essentially worthless to me if I leave my home.I am returning this junk tomorrow and ordering a Dlink setup, which I should have done in the first place. Argh."
A20M2752EP9YU1,Very Disappointed,"This radio has poor reception! Based on other reviews,I thought this sounded like a really good radio, so I bought it. I've used this radio since this spring. I replaced the ear buds that came with the radio with a pair of Sony ear buds.Something went wrong with the FM tuner.The FM staitions no longer come in at all. I Now can only pick up AM.I do have two good things to say.#1 The digital tuner is nice(WHEN IT WAS WORKING!!!) #2 It had pretty good sound.Over all I would NOT recommend this Radio!UPDATE 6/9/2013I have several of these now. I use them for mowing lawn, general yard work, ect. Even when I am washing out pig barns. I have to say that these are a tuff little radio! I once left out out in the rain overnight by accident. Dried it out compleatly and it still worked! Only down side is they have a hiss when played at low voulme, and I still throw out the ear buds that come with the radio and use Sonys.FM works great too. I must have had one that had poor reception.I now give this radio 4 stars!"
A9345SP41JBU7,replacement power cord,"We bought it for a 50 inch plasma. It did what it was supposed to, so it is a great product. No complaints."
A24DBUIAWDQXA2,Very versatile for the web and family/personal photos.,I have had this camera for about a year now and have become the photographer of the family even though others have much more expensive equipment and I really don't know anything about photography.  The detail in the photos along with the color are excellent.  Its alse easy enough to use that you don't have to read the booklet.  The little LCD sreen is not great but it is useful.  It will also print out an impressive 8X10 even though 5x7 is where it really shines.It also does a good job with photos to put on the web whether you are trading pics with distant friends/family or selling items on the net or auctions.  The close-up feature is really great to show detail when selling items as detail helps bring more money when selling/auctioning.This is just a great camera and now there are many opportunities to get it for a lot less than cameras that don't really do much more for the simple photographer.
A1E28N4W6CVGTI,Several significant annoyances,"I bought this system for use as an alarm clock as well as a mini audio system in my bedroom. Based on several issues, I've decided to return it. 1. The panel is way too bright. At its brightest setting you could easily read a book. At its dimmest, it still casts significant light. 2. The clock itself is too small to read unless you're very close to it. 3. The speaker cables are very short - 6 feet?, and they don't detach from the speakers, so they can't be replaced. 4. The CD mechanism is very loud, slow and clunky. 5. The buttons on the remote are small, mostly identical, and poorly labeled. 6. Sound is OK, but not impressive. If you have no intention of using the alarm functionality and don't might the brightness, it may be an OK choice, but I wouldn't recommend it."
A32HWRCVJ2VFL9,I love this bag,"I usually carry a Canon 5D with 17-40mm, 50mm and 28-135/or100mm macro in this bag.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, its easy to swing it round to the front and grab what you need.  The front pouch is much bigger than it appears.  I currently have the following in there:2 spare batteries, battery charger, small collapsible tabletop tripod, 3-4 filters, remote trigger, pen, pad of paper,8 extra memory cards.  I like the fact that I can still carry a daypack on a hike and have all my camera gear along.  Actually the daypack rests on the camera bag as an added bonus.  I hope they never stop making these, although I've had mine for 4 years now and no sign of wear yet."
A3BJO8SQPA7HD0,Do NOT skip buying this!,Built my system with this and nothing went wrong; can't say if this is the reason why but it surely didn't do any harm for 7 bucks.
A29NLMUECXUAGG,excellent binoculars for a good price,I bought these based on a friend that ownes the same pair. The autofocus and clarity makes up for the weight. It would be nice if they included a more comfortable strap. Very thin for the weight and size of these binoculars. But I bought them for performance and I was not let down.
A2BRWT4QA3X8HC,new headset,"This is a really great item, priced good and in good working order.  Arrived in tip top shape and in a timely manner.  I LOVE IT !"
A2Y9NXMP0PN3NB,Non-Functional,"This charger arrived in a timely manner, the little red light on the unit lit up; sadly, it failed to charge the Garmin GPS.  Very inexpensive unit-got what I paid for."
A35JDFJ2VLKB51,Perfect,"Gave this to my son in law, and he said it was just what he needed for the bug zapper."
A269VOM10K2MLG,Painful disappointment,"I was so exicted to imagine that I could easily gather Gutenberg classic books, for free, and then read them anywhere. The eBookman was the answer, I was certain, for a webby person who was in danger of forgetting how to read more than one paragraph on a single topic.Sadly, the eBookman does not live up to expectations. Simply put, it is poorly built, poorly designed and very poorly supported. My eBookamn lived about 3 months before various buttons crushed in and the navagation wheel fell off. Long before then, the eBookman found reasons to crash during simple opperations like... turning it on... or uploading a book. As has been mentioned over and over, the batteries will die within a few days of installation whether you use the unit or not. Franklin did little to support its customers even during the eBookman's primetime, and now I shudder to think what users do if they encounter problems.My eBookman was laid to rest after less than 6 months of ownership when it no longer functioned in any form and Franklin failed to offer any significant help or restitution."
A2BDU55PWTKP5Y,sony shower radio,"Very happy with this radio, it gets great reception and sounds great also."
A1AR3FDLWCOJ34,FS-108 Has A Small Backplane That Causes Long Delays.,Netgear's switch can use a larger backplane. I put this switch to the test  and found that it cannot support my busy network. I called technical  support for assistance and received a rep. who told me that I needed  another switch because the backplane found in the FS-108 is not big enough  for my network. If it cannot support 8 computers - Why build an 8-port  switch? This is a waste of money and time!!!
A1WR0KA61A2CTW,"JUNK - Buy an ART 341 for less, much better!","Had this and now have an ART 341 EQ for $99.  No comparison!  ART is actually DJ/real quality with unbalanced RCA jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro use.Ultra-quiet, high quality potentiometers, discrete 2-channels with output control, clipping indicators, 6 or 12 db scale select for each channel.  Ground lift select for possible source grounding problems.Just need to buy 4 rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting, rather than rack mounting.  Comes without feet and rack ears for 19"" rack.  Much nicer EQ than this Audio Source junk, and I've owned both."
A1UDQQU0EPVH8C,Right for a light....,"I don't believe any power cord should be less then 16 gauge. These 25 footers are only 18 gauge, but since I'm only using them for stage lighting, they are perfect. Would definately NOT use them for amps or high powered speakers.Makes set up easy for lights up on trusses (no more extension cords). For the price they're a bargain. I got 4, will most likely get 2 more."
A3CKF4XV71S7HD,Great tool for preventing damaging electrical spikes,Recommended by a TV repairman to prevent electrical surges from harming my TV's and computer.  Not a looker but definitely a worker.
A2A3B0JX2JRS6S,in love with this mount,Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.
AOB68J099DJJ4,Great,"Bought this a while ago for college and I am quite pleased with it! Has pretty great quality sound in general, but it's even better for the money you pay. This isn't the loudest, but that isn't what I was looking for. It goes plenty loud for me, but if you want a super loud/high sound quality system, I'd look into more expensive alternatives. I don't think it's even fair to criticize this in any way for the amount of money you pay. Very pleased with it!"
A2IKA32YQXLDUF,Off the beaten track--with confidence!,"Late this summer, I was driving a rented minivan from Mendocino, CA, south to the Bay area. It's about 180 miles. I was with three other adults and three children. Instead of taking the recommended RT 128 southeast to RT 101 and south to the Bay area, we decided to take a ""shorter"" route, due east on Lake Road to RT 20 to RT 101, then south. Well, the road we chose went through deep redwood forests. More often then not, we could not see the sky. There were times when the road was no longer paved, at times rutted. It was so narrow that for most of the way it would have been impossible for two vehicles to pass (fortunately, no vehicles came our way). The road often snaked around tree trunks as large as 10 feet in diameter.This road was on both our AAA map and GPS (I had preloaded the corresponding map onto my 64mb data card from the MetroGuide CD). The going was very slow, and our ""shorter"" route soon became the ""longer"" route. We were too far along to turn around. My wife, seated in the back held the portable phone ready to call for assistance. I asked all to wait, to put her trust in the GPS. After another half hour, we came to a three-road junction--all narrow and un-maintained. One of the roads was not on the AAA map. Intuitively, it looked like the least likely road. But the GPS indicated this road would take us to the RT 20. We took it, and before you knew it, arrived at the conventional RT 20. The GPS saved the day.One of the greatest attributes of a GPS is that it allows you to explore, to go where you normally would not, and discover new vistas. Obviously, my eMap proved that.Besides this general function, there are several specific features I like about the eMap. These include its portability and its ergonomic design. The eMap has a relatively large display (which can be backlit) and it is light, just over 6 oz. When walking with this unit in a town or on a trail, I appreciate being able to hold and control the unit with one hand while always having the display in view. This is a result of the control buttons being below the screen.The eMap is compatible with Garmin's downloadable MapSource CDs. These include U.S. Roads and Recreation, WorldMap, U.S. Topo, and MetroGuide U.S.A. With the MapGuide U.S.A. CD, the eMap can look up addresses and telephone numbers for nearby services and points of interest. I like being able find a particular restaurant or street address by entering it under the find feature, then tracking it. An arrow will point in the right direction and distance will be displayed.There are many available accessories, several which I recommend. I needed a larger data card. The unit comes with an 8mb card which will give you one region. This is okay if you will be using it in a limited radius. If you go elsewhere, you'll need to load new data using a serial cable (another accessory). It is time consuming, which may suggest your getting another accessory, the Garmin's USB data programmer. I have a 64mb card which captures from Massachusetts to Maryland (8 regions). Using the serial cable took over two hours to load the data. Using the programmer took about four minutes.I definitely recommend this unit. Its portability, versatility, its adjustable detail, and its accuracy give you the confidence to venture places without getting lost. One suggestion though--don't give up the paper map. Use it to provide the fuller perspective a portable GPS lacks."
A3N3NI5R59PGIT,I am very pleased with this purchase!!!!!,The seller provided everything they agreed to provide.  I would definately do business with this seller again.
AOZ715G9SJ1IJ,An expensive piece of garbage,"I bought this thing becuase I use voice recognition with my computer and I'm on the phone quite a bit. it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets.  With the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it The total cost came to around $200. Yay!The amplifier has a strong hum when used through the phone and when I use it witht eh computer it has such poor sound quality that it doesn't work with my voice rec. software. I called customer service and they said I should send the unit to them and they would send me a new one. Funny,  I have read that in a few places online.I went out and bought the Labtec equivelent, the dialog-301 at a whopping $15 (headset included, the head set is cheap though) and it is chrystal clear for both the phone and my computer. Plus if you want to upgrade the head set you can buy any analog computer headset.Save yourself $185 and just buy the dialog-301 you will be happy."
AUM8602UZW29M,Worked fine to connect XP to Laserjet 4MP,"I purchased this cable to connect an old HP Laserjet 4MP to a 5 yr old Sony Vaio notebook running Windows XP.  XP recognized the printer immediately and installed the correct driver. The cable performed perfectly.  The cable I received is black and not the white/light color in the current product photo, which is fine by me (I prefer it!)"
A8WO7N0INONVU,wonderful learning experience1,This game is absolutely wonderful. Great educational value and fun at the same time. Very easy to play and my six year old doesn't even realize he's learning.....just having fun! Very easy to play. We pull this game out over and over again!
A2AZWCITJKQMWA,Cheap,No single view. Lenses are not aligned properly so you see two round views as opposed to one pic that you should see in a quality binoc.
AN399ZWEBXSKY,Telescopio,El producto es un complemento ideal para ampliar las cualidades de un telescopio. Es un producto fino y &uacute;til. Estoy satisfecho con el desempe&ntilde;o adicional que me ha Generado.
AXFIGG1VEACRO,"Good sound, not very durable","Koss headphones have been around for a long time.  I sold them as a audio consultant over 30 years ago.  After looking at reviews that have been written, there are points that were brought up in some of the reviews that I disagree with.The metal band that reviewers mentioned as uncomfortable wasn't an issue from my perspective.  The comfort zone feature that adjusts how the headphones meet the ear is nearly worthless.  The settings do not stay set and is fragile. The headphones were good at becoming compact enough to fit in the case provided.My biggest disappointment wasn't the sound quality, or comfort.  It is the poor durability.  The ear pieces ""float"" to maximize comfort, but I found that the ear piece would break loose.  Initially, I could pop them back on, but because they are made from plastic, it got to the point where they couldn't be reattached.  They became useless.If you are looking for good headphones that you can use for a while, I can not recommend the Koss PortaPro"
A1R59N965DZU0L,Disappointed!:o(,"Im here reading reviews trying to figure how I can email my photos. I  hoping maybe its just the SORRY software program that came with the camera.  I have aol at home and have yet to figure out how to email my pics. Tried  polaroid tech, have to say they were no help what so ever!Ive got a few  ideas from other reviews to try when I get home that will hopefully work.  One thing for sure I did learn was I need to go purchase rechargable  batteries.Unless some of your suggestions work the camera is going back  to the store Monday.All its been is one big headache!!"
AB966506BC8G4,Throw your Palms Away.,"To the meat of this review.A Palm or Handspring is fine but the HP is a true pocket PC.  Add a type 1, 128-MB flash chip and you have something you can use to do almost anything you do on your desktop computer.  I have passed Excel and Word documents between the desktop and the HP and edited in both locations and it works flawlessly.  Connection at home to Outlook and at work to Lotus Notes 4.6 using Intellisync software.  All notes, Emails, address books, to do, calendar sync flawlessly and are there to remind, use and edit.  The Targus keyboard is wonderful for large data entry at high speed.  Microsoft site has free program enhancements that allow you to have the HP screen displayed on your desktop PC while synced.  One can work to the HP while being synced to the desktop.  I listen to MP3 and the free media player allows viewing of MPG videos.  I have taken pictures in the plant with the Nikon digital camera and pulled its type 1 flash card out and placed it directly in the HP and am able to view the pictures directly on the screen or pass them to the desktop.  The USB sync is very fast.  I have used a PCMCIA adapter and type 1 flash card to gather and pass files between machines in the plant and into the HP.  Calling cards and addresses and notes, etc, can be passed to Palms via infrared but, remember, the Palm is limited on what it can accept and on its memory.  You have to think small when comparing this to a Palm.  Ebooks, well, you can read them or listen to them while going on a trip or just at home.  The ease of use is a natural if you are familiar with Windows operating systems.The HP is very rugged and reliable.  The only drawback I have with it is the screen is difficult to see in direct sun light.There are other Pocket PCs out there that are faster and have brighter screens but I don&#8217;t think they will be able to match the ruggedness or the appeal of appearance this professional machine has to offer.  The HP is the only one out there that has a button on the top to turn the screen off and leave the computer on.  This mode extends the battery live when listening to MP3s.Get the clear screen covers to protect your screen and some spare HP pointers.  If you have a serial sync, I urge you to upgrade to the USB cradle for high-speed synchronization.As a side note, the folks with the Palms and Handspring devices no longer come by and say, &#8220; Hay, look what I can do on this thing.&#8221;  Remember that a Palm is a Palm and the HP is a PC."
A3SCTA36FA7E88,the industry standard as far as i'm concerned,"i'm a professional dj, and i've been using my mdr.4700dj for almost ten years.  they're the best dj monitor headphones i've owned.  i know many new products (such as the popular pioneers) have come out since; and to be honest, i haven't tried many of them; but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past.  when you first get them, you might get confused about how to fold them back up. i think i was confused for a little, but maybe i'm just not that bright.  the sound is great, and the construction is definitely solid."
A4YAXWNMWYY0K,Asolutely the most expensive paperweight I own,"I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10"" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color."
AU6AVYPPDDWI6,It is the best Palm ever!,"As an avid gadgeteer and a devout Palmer I was excited to hear about a color version of the 5. It was everyting I expected and more. It reacts faster, keeps the charge longer, and it syncs super fast- and its color! When you first turn it on it seems to be darker than the old- and it is. The backlight makes viewing perfect. Leave it to Palm programmers to fix the problem by writing an app to automatically turn on the backlight (Carzy Diamond- a free app- can be downloaded from palgear.com). For those of you who have an older version it is worth the upgrade.And don;t forget the expansion slot..."
A10WET3ZP50AFG,It works,"Not much to write, this is a great addition for those headphones which don't have their own volume control and you don't want to mess with the Windows volume or your music player volume.I just put them on high and control the volume through this instead.Recommended."
A21L12NT10X25E,a quality cord,"I have found this to be a reliable cord,  I use it for hand tools etc. and lighting and have no problems with it, the 16/3 wire is good enough for the uses I have for it."

AWT9JKJSNZU2V,Great Old Model Etrex,"Worked great for me for many years. I really loved that this unit was waterproof. I only gave it 3 stars because the signal reception was VERY weak. It would go in and out under the slightest tree cover. I recently cracked the screen on this unit and upgraded to the new Etrex models, which are of course much better. Wasn't the GPS's fault, but rather mine as I put it in a checked bag at the airport."
A14DP2QGYQOBVU,Great,This is a great filter at a fantastic price! It will protect your lens from all kinds of dirt & dust!
A216WFBI15Q4T2,TV is still on the wall,"TV has been mounted about two weeks and still holding up.  Pretty easy to adjust the TV to different angles.  Overall installing the TV mount wasn't hard.  The only thing that gave us a little trouble was the TV had a little raised curve on the back.  Therefore when we tried to attach the bar that connects to the TV, the bars did not sit flush.  We had to cut those bars down to get a flush mount.  Not sure if that is a fault of the TV mount or the TV itself.  Note: I don't know how the mounting sizes are created, i.e. 300x300, but the mount did say it would fit my TV and we still had to cut those bars.  Not a big deal to me and the mount still works well but this is something you may want to factor into your buying decision.  For those green people, packaging was really good on this, not much wasted/open space."
A2R3UNXQYM1WK8,128 bit encryption with some effort,"After a few hours of experimenting, I have the D-Link DWL-650 running with 128 bit encryption with a Linksys BEFW11SW Wireless Access Point.  This required the latest Linksys firmware upgrade, 1.37.9b, dated 6/21/2001.  Without this firmware, WEP (Wireless Encryption Protocol) had to be disabled between the D-Link and Linksys products. I had to re-boot my Windows 2000 machine 3 times before the D-Link driver installed completely (it seemed to go a little farther each time.)  I had a scare after upgrading the Linksys firmware, it locked up, but was fine after a power cycle.  The placement of the wireless access point is critical to good connectivity.  Aluminum heating vents definitely block the signal.  Luckily, I found a spot in my office that gets 11 Mb transmission to almost all of my 3400 square foot home, the key was to get it away from the vent system, so it has a clean line of sight to the rest of the rooms."
A2BXZFSCJH5SX9,Pretty good set of headphones.,"Pretty good.  They have good sound for the price.  Next time I would pay a little extra for an even better set, but for the price they are pretty good."
AHFJQOHGJRK84,Satisfied,This is my first tablet. I can see it is not perfect but it basically does about everything I need to do. It seems like every tablet has its pluses and minuses. I like the highlighting in multiple colors on this one. My primary intent in the tablet was for reading.
A3PQB89UT76F8M,Does what it should,"It's a circular polarizer, a pretty good one too.  This particular one takes about 1 to 2 stops out of your exposure.  I use it for the ND effect sometimes.  No problems with it on my Nikon 80-200 or 24-70."
A3QVEYO6AT2DEF,Good Investment,"This purchase was my first digital camera. I waited until now because I wanted a camera with good resolution at an affordable price. This is truely an excellent camera. When used properly, it takes fantastic photos. The battery goes forever. The addition of 64/120 MB cards allowed me to take tons of photos. Why 4 stars? (1) The resolution on the 30 sec video could be better. (2) In low light situations (camera on auto), if you turn the flash off, photos mostly blurr(not always). You get a &quot;shaky camera&quot; icon and even if the camera is on a tripod, photos are sometimes blurred. This has caused me to miss some great shots."

A344BZFHITGO3M,"High quality pictures, exceptional value","The DC3400 was my first digital camera, and having had it for several months, I can truly say it has outperformed my expectations.  The picture quality is terrific, even at the lower resolution settings, allowing you to 'dial in' for your needs - lower resolution for webpages/email, higher resolution for photo prints, etc.We recently attended a wedding, and with my 128mb CF card, I took over 130 pictures, several of which the bride liked better than her professional photographer's version.My mom recently bought the DC3400EZ, and has been just as pleased.  Kodak hit the mark with this camera."
A3R8C4W615KB87,Pleased with this product.,This product meets my needs exactly as I hoped.  It was easy to set up and learn to use.  I have enjoyed my music so much more by being able to select from so many CDs.  I like being able to program my favorites.  Excellent product.

Make sure to verify that the holes on your TV/Monitor will match up with the mounting plate....if not make sure to order the adapter for this.

A3CZRD1BX22GWG,Pretty good player,"As a guitar teacher, I have worn out a dozen or so of these in the past 25 years and this one seems to be pretty tough and sounds great.  I'll tell you more in 25 years."
A2P56EJXR42G2V,Not bad at all!,"I've put these headphones through their paces for a couple of weeks now.  After winning a new set on eBay ($25, incl. shipping), I noticed several bad reviews on Amazon.com and epinions.com, so I didn't expect much.  That said, I've been very pleased with these headphones.  I've listened to everything from Bach to Metallica, and they've performed without a hitch.  I haven't tried 328 feet, but I've gone at least 100' (to take the trash out to the curb) and they've worked great.  No, they don't deliver the bass punch of my old JVC corded phones, but the trade-off is that I can walk to the next room without knocking things off of shelves now.  Yes, you do need to adjust the tuning from time to time, but certainly not as often as some reviewers claim.  These are my first 'wireless' headphones, and I'm very pleased.  I'm a long-time JVC user, and I think they live up to the reputation."
A1GIV9XNMMRD6I,Perfect for someone just getting started.,Granted there might be better glass filters available for 3x or 4x as much... but these are perfect for someone just getting into photography or someone that might scratch there filters cause they are rough with their equipment... Personally I tend to be someone rough with my camera equipment so spending over a hundred dollars on filters doesn't make sense to me... I'd rather get something less pricey and if i scratch it it doesn't hurt so much when i replace it...
A3RJ7V6NMKUZU2,Happy with these cans!,"I was looking for a set of headphones to enhance the experience of the new ipod touch I just bought.After reading page after page of 4 and 5 star reviews for these, I decided to pick up a pair for $30.Came yesterday. Many reviews mentioned how they were smaller than expected, so these were about the size that I expected.Even with review-hyped anticipation, these did not disappoint. Sound full and distortion free, great bass, clear highs.I listened to several well-known favorite tracks formerly experienced only with earbuds, now the buds sound anemic in comparison.As noted by others, I'm hearing details formerly missed.If you turn the sound volume past 60% or so, the open design will leak sound to those around you (Not noise canceling headphones).I threw away the included too-small leatherette pouch; folded, the headphones fit nicely into a small tupperware container I had, for a cheap waterproof rigid case for the rigors of travel they will certainly be subjected to.Longevity?: too early to tell. I tend to treat these things gently, so I hope to not have to use the limited lifetime warranty any time soon.For thirty bucks, great deal, get 'em!"
AY525O66C3ML2,"Lee from San Jose, CA",No support for Win/NT or Win2000. I can't justify to go out and buy a PC with Win95/98/Me in order to run this product; I already own 3 PCs with Win/NT or Win2000.
A28FOVRA0OTN8R,Capture any monent,"My previous camcorder broke and I waited awhile before buying a new one. I did some research and chose this camera. Its great, The best part is not having to squint into a tiny black and white hole when trying to record  something. The camera offers lots of fun features that enable you to make  interesting videos. A  downside is it tends to be a bit bulky at times but  I would rather take that over a bigger camera. And also the one touch LCD  screen sometimes looks a bit dirty but only two faults after six months of  great recording!"
A35BWVLNTZ2VQJ,I'm not an audiophile,"I'm currently in the process of following AJATT. Which means I'm creating an artificial immersion environment in order to learn a foreign language, which means I listen to a lot of my target language, close to 4-5 hours a day with these. These headphones are awesome, extremely comfortable, and very good at blocking out the noise. My head doesn't feel like it's been in a vice-grip after extended use.I'm not an audiophile so I won't pretend to be one, but these are the best headphones that I've ever used. They sound awesome, plenty of bass.They are bit clunky and not that portable, but that's not really their purpose.The cord is huge, thick, and coiled. Very nice if you have to get up and move around the room. It stretches plenty but doesn't get tangled because it's coiled.Not to mention that I notice them being used by professionals everywhere (camera men, sound guys, DJs, Radio talk show hosts).They come with a nice faux-leather bag with a draw-string to transport them."
A2ZL85XLG9JGOV,"don't rush buy the 128 mb, it will get cheaper","This camera is a good long term investment considering its great picture qualities and ease of use. I think it's the best 2 megapixel camera so far- it is compact, has a cool design, and, of course, its pictures quality is amazing. People recommend that you should have a 128 mb flash card. It's true , but getting the 64 mb one is more than enough. I would suggest you to get the 128 mb or higher later until the price drops again. the bottom line is that this camera is truly the best considering at the price and quality. You won't regret it."
A3I0FGXON9W6X7,JUST WONDERFUL!!!!!,"I HAVE TROUBLE OPERATING A REGULAR MOUSE,BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS,AND THIS ITEM IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.I HAD A TOUCH PAD BEFORE,BUT THIS IS CONVENIENT BEING ON THE KEYBOARD.I LOVE IT!!!!!!"
A2AGLT0P0STCQO,Great Mom Camera Replacment Gift!!,"Our elderly Mom loves her 'older style' Sony camera but she just wore it out!  We were delighted to find an upgraded Sony Mavica model for her and it was a great replacement gift!  The price was excellent, the online description was perfect, it was shipped immediately and exactly as promised.  We tested the camera before sending to Mom (leaving a few photos of us) -- but we know she will love her new camera!  This seller took extra care in packing the goods by inserting into a plastic bag & double bubble wrapping - he included all the parts & pieces ... even tossed in some extra discs & hard to find software.  The shipping was more costly than posted but we didn't have to pay extra charges - thanks for that!  If we need another camera -- we'll look for his camera site first!  Thanks for making our Birthday Mom very happy.... we can't get her to switch to a new smaller camera - but finding the old style for her 83 year old hands was a treat for all of us!!!"
A19E8HEVUS9CNR,Gets the job done.,Needed a longer cable to connect my printer to my new USB hub at my desk.This did the trick.Works perfect.
ABH6QLP3E97F1,Worth the money,THIS PORTABLE CD PLAYER IS GREAT!!! My friends think that it cost me $300  and i had to prove it wasnt i think if you like comfort quality and saving  money this is a perfect item for you!
A1EXTZ4VQUSPL,Does Not fit.,"I bought this to replace my OEM for my canon T4i, but it did not fit right.  The actual piece blocked the sensor right above it.  This cause the camera does not switched between menu screen and live view shot.  Consider the EF instead of EB style."
A1D0JJRXG5EZ3C,Great Value!,"As an entry level digital camera, this is a great value.  For $299 I wasn't expecting miracles, but I've been very impressed so far with this camera.  Photo quality indoors, even at the lowest resolution, is amazingly good for Web work.  Outdoors photos can sometimes get a little washed out,  typically in very high contrast situations.Other reviewers have  mentioned their frustration with very short battery life.  I too  experienced this for the first few days.  Expecting the 500 photos per set  of 4 AA batteries the manual told of, I was very disappointed when I got  maybe 30-35 shots before having to put in fresh batteries!  I later learned  that two things contributed to the short battery life.  (1) Constant use of  the flash.  This situation can be fixed by turning off the auto flash when  not needed, especially in most outdoor situations.  (2) Constant use of the  LCD screen.  I thought it was cool at first, that you didn't even have to  use the viewfinder--just frame your shots on the LCD!  Come to find out,  doing this sucks the life out of the batteries super fast.  So use the  traditional viewfinder to take pictures; if you're not sure how the picture  came out and want to review it, use the LCD screen.Lately, following  the two rules above, I've been getting 200-300 pictures per set of  batteries--including about 30-50 with the flash on.  This is perfectly  acceptable.HP's $50 AC adapter should be priced at  about $9.99.  Instead, buy yourself a good quality set of rechargeable  batteries and a charger (you can find them for about $30).  This is a much  more flexible solution that an AC adapter, especially if you get the 12  volt adapter for the charger so you can charge your batteries while on the  road!"
ACHMAK6A8MHH,"Overpriced, but works as described.","I just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what I paid for the whole unit with a couple of these. Overall, it works as described so I only docked it 1 star for the price."
A2IV124H3FG64H,Very good unit,"I bought this unit about three weeks ago and it seems to work great.  The only reason I gave it a four star is because I have not recorded on it yet, so I don't know how well it records, other then that I'm very happy with  it."
A3IUX9ORAHPQRV,"Good Player, Bad Docking Station, Bad Company","The player seems to work fine, although the interface is a bit awkward but you get used to it quickly.My biggest gripe is the docking station. I'm on my second one. With the first one, the little connection broke after just a few uses. After the long hassle of RMA's from the on-line company (not Amazon) that I bought it from, I got the new one, plugged it in and didn't play with it for a few months.After a few months have passed (and the short, 90 warrenty) I used it twice. Most of the time it just sat in the docking station next to my computer on my desk. Recently, when I wanted to start using it again, I noticed that the charge light no longer came on. I called Creative (toll call, on hold for a while), told them of the problem, they want me to pay for shipping, pay them $20 to diagnose their problem, and then have me pay for the replacement part and the shipping. I've used the new one all of three times and it is in brand new condition. And they won't ship the new part until they get the old! Even though I am paying for it! Lame.I give the player good marks, but the docking station has quality issues and Creative Labs has severe support issues. I will never buy a CL product again.-mike"
A2TGFOJNOHYDMW,Save your money,Don't fall for the hype. It will be collecting dust in no time after you get tired of the out of focus pics and the colors aren't THAT saturated. The night photos are ok but nothing to brag on. Use your money on something that will keep you taking pics for the long haul.
A2QSPIWLVBV3E5,BAD PRODUCT,Purchased this propuct from .... Within 30 days one port went dead.  Within another 60 days 2 more ports dead.  NO responce from Linksys tech support.  Will not return calls.  Buy another product.
A239ON6G2S2E9E,"""Perfect Cable when You Need a Little Length""","This is the cable to get if you want to connect two computers together. You won't need a router for this, just a network card in each machine.Flash drives and DVDs are fine for archiving or transferring relatively small files and folders, but this can really move the information. It's great for backing up an entire computer, and in a ""rescue operation,"" with one machine teetering on the brink of disaster, it can really save the day. In a normal setting, it's great for shuffling entire music or photo collections.I've had good luck with Belkin products, and this is a perfect example. Durability has been a pleasant surprise; I've used the same cables for years, and they still work like new. I couldn't be more satisfied with their performance. Fast, safe, and reliable data transfer at a sensational price."
A1ZDPQA6FLY8XM,It really works,"Three days ago I received this camera. Initially I had some problems when I tried to make the software work with my Windows XP Hewlett Packard PC but the website (whose URL is written in the documents but I cannot write it here) offered me all the necessary new drivers, programs, updates, and also some very relevant information and the reason of the error messages was fixed soon. Don't expect miracles; the main miracle is that a (Chinese) machine for this miniscule price like that works at all. You can impress the people who have bought a single camera for the price of 34 JamCams, e.g. my roommate.The resolution is 640x480 but I have to reduce the size to 400x300 or so if the picture should look smooth. But the resulting 20kB JPEG pictures are appropriate for fast websites and you can do a lot of them. For example, you can try to search for &quot;hyupsing qong&quot; at Google and you might find some pictures prepared by JamCam quickly. The flash recharges every time you turn the camera on and it is probably the main killer of the (9V) battery. But don't give it up: the battery is sometimes down only for a while and then it gains the lost power again. I believe that one battery could be enough for 100 pictures or so. The timer works, too. Colors can be &quot;washed out&quot; if you use the flash from less than 6 feet. But without the flash, you can sometimes see a strange pixelization of some nearby objects. I recommend to take mostly outside pictures during the day but the camera is good for many other practical purposes."
A18G2CHZP6EO96,"""Save My Neck""","I spend a lot of time on the phone for business and without a headset my neck goes into painful spasms.  Plantronics has the best product available and ""saves my neck""!"
A29GBWT370171W,"Good product, finding spare fuses is an issue","I bought this converter to replace one that fell apart.  It did a good job for me in Europe, and the packaging is rugged enough for travel.  It uses fuses, and I wanted to travel with spares.  The 20mm x 5mm, 10-amp fuses turn out to be a non-standard item that is hard to find in stores in the US, and had to be mail-ordered.  The fuses say ""F-1"" on them, which turned out to refer to the wrong type of fuse in US catalogs.  When I went by the measurements and amperage, I got the right ones.  Of course, the shipping cost far more than the fuses.  It would be nice if the seller offered the option of buying spare fuses along with the converter."
A246VGCJLLXGDX,I have two sets that are great,"I'm not an audiophile, but I love these darn speakers. In fact, two friends of mine in the film business were here yesterday and both commented on them without prompting from me, and were amazed at the sound.I've had one set for years, then someone gave me a brand new set they didn't want that I've run for at least two years now.And, the ones I bought were so cheap, too! So, I'm happy...."
A51XRJDV650S0,It is great case for IPAQ,"I am an engineering student. which means no buget to spend the delux case for ipaq. However i need it.I spent much time to look for the right case for my lovely ipaq. Here is my consideration for this reseach.1. Price ....2. Protect (it must be OK, if i drop it 5 feet above the floor)3. Fit for CF sleev case. ( I want to bring 32M flash memory for listening music--- MP3 Player)I decide to have a case for IPAQ. I had three considerations.I was researching for that.The first option is Compaq case . It is expensive and not fit with CF case.The second option is Frankln Case . It is good but not sure to fit with CF case. I e-mail them to check my consideration but no answer from them.The third option is sumdex case. Well I recommend you to visitsumdex.com. You will see their price for this case. The good things is a dimentions  Exterior: 5.5"" x 4"" x 1"" Weight: 1 oz.The put this information on web. Well, I am an engineering student. I need to make sure every facts to all right for my ipaq. I measured my ipaq and draw  5.5"" x 4"" x 1"" on paper. I made a test case with paper. My conclution is the right case for ipaq with CF case. I droped it 5feet above floor. just tested it. The result of experiment is OK. It is passed on my dropping test. The price is great for student. It is really leather. You can smell. If you drop sumdex.com, you will get the information fo this material. I love this case. I throw my wallet and put ID card and credit case with ipaq. I highly recommend this case for ipaq user..."
A2Z88UAPBUWIYN,Just what I needed.,Enough said- I wasn't able to find anything around my area that could be of use and was able to get this with free shipping when I ordered a couple CD's.
A29ZXUZN9BWD15,Not as precise,"I got this mouse cause I knew of the preciseness of the optical mice, and I was normally a fan of the Logitech products.But, I do have to say this isn't as precise as I required. For some reason, this mouse does little 0.5 second stalls, almost constantly. Simple test of mine involved moving the mouse in a small 1 inch up/down motion to see where the point ends up.It never stays in place on the screen, but rather at the very top or bottom of my screen eventually. All that time I didn't move the mouse more than 2 inches on my desktop.For an every day use mouse, something that doesn't require as much preciseness, it's a great mouse, but for what I do, it stalled too much for my uses."
A1UU077IV7OLGD,Good size,It is a good size to put in hundreds of CD's and it has the inserts sideways so the CD's won't fall out if you open it accidentally when it's being carried.
A4PA1HC5LDEI1,Do not buy,"While these are nice and comfy, the connector breaks easily and the ""skin"" peals off easily and with average or quicker than expected time..."
A2VP6PJ4RGLDBY,Only one complaint,"My only complaint is that it's a pretty tight fit for liner notes. I had to do some adjusting to get some to fit at all. But from all the binders I researched, I'd probably still choose this one.There's more space available even when filled to original capacity, so I want to buy refill pages, but they're currently out of stock here on Amazon as well as on Case Logic's website.It's bulkier (wider spine than another CD binder I have with the same capacity), but this also allows for putting in refill pages to completely fill it up."
A1K9FR6C0L20AO,At least the headphones worked....,I thought CD players were supposed to actually play music.  This one doesn't.
A2DBKSVXYC15X0,Startech 10/100Mbps PCI Fast Enet Network Card,"It's your basic network card but for some reason, the internal built-in card on my desktop would not work so I bought this from Amazon and it worked like a champ when I put it in!  The computer has a wireless card in it which was working but I prefer to just have them hooked up by the cable when I'm reinstalling windows so I don't have any problems with trying to get updates or drivers during the installation and afterwards updating the computer.If you need one, then get this one.  Great price and works great!@"
A1USS3XKWT0LHJ,Not Good,It took forever to charge and did not meet my expectations. The quality was not what was advertised. Would not buy again.
A2AXLB80YUCLCI,The best,This is one of the best batteries i have ever used. I recommend that you should buy it if you have the option. Will work for long time.
A2RLKTTQCKAE88,Panasonic disapointment,I purchaced one of these at a local store and found it to be one of the least functional pieces of equipment that I have ever purchased.  The buttons were hard to control and the anti-skip was non-existant.  For my  purposes I decided to return the item and look for one more suitable to for  jogging or exercise.
A2N0XN3PYG5YNX,Not one single picture came out,"I bought this for our Jamaica trip because we were planning on going to the Dunn's River waterfall and I didn't want to get my regular digital camera wet. When we got there I changed my mind and used my digital camera anyway but since I didn't want to let this disposable one go to waste I just ended up taking random pictures around the resort and filled it up that way. When we got back home and I had it developed not one single picture came out and I didn't even use it in or around water, I only took outdoors pictures around the resort in bright daylight. Since I used my regular camera for all the important stuff I didn't really care but if I had used it for something important it would have turned into a huge disappointment.  Not sure how it works under water but since it can't even get a good shot outside the water I'm assuming it won't do much better under water. Think twice before buying one of these."
A3HJ888Q5EOO66,Wall Mount,"Heavy duty construction, easy to install, could have easer adjustment knobs as I use this on an RV and constantly make mount adjustments. Other than that this is a great product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone."
A3M3CZ0MVUOED0,Good affordable cable. Snug/Secure fit. Happy Buyer,This is the power cable I needed to use with my Desktop PC and it worked wonderfully. The fit on both ends was snug and secure. I didn't experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all. It plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally. PC powered up immediately on first try - which really doesn't need to be said...The bonus - it's really cheap!
A39ETIAGC8XFL8,Product and Service...AWESOME,Received the product very fast.  You can't beat the price and the product works perfectly.  Will be shopping on Amazon more and more.
A258NDMTLH29RJ,Midland 40 channel cb,I have purchased two of these radios and they work great! When we go camping the wife uses one to communicate with me when we are backing up our fifth wheel camper.
AV7O4AX4RC2GF,Just as it looks,just paper sleeves! no more no less. Great to draw on for personal gifts (with a cd inside of course!)
A3IP8Q5WMM1K00,Good device back in 2004,"I think I bought this device around 2004. Back then, the eTrex Legend was an acceptable device for its price. I used it in various situations: on roadtrips, sailing, hiking etc. And it's always been a helpful piece of equipment. Two things that are annoying about the Legend are: First, its slow GPS chip which takes about a few minutes under clear sky to get a signal. And second, its battery consumption. If you don't use the display light, the device will last for 20+ hours. But if you use the light, the batteries will drain quickly. Now, in 2014, I wouldn't buy this device anymore, not even second-hand. You'd be be better off with an eTrex 20 or 30."
A3QYZXPJZ6IT7H,Well Pleased,Was received in great condition & we also received an upgrade at no extra cost which was very nice.Will make watching old memories much more pleasurable as it runs so quiet.
A89DO69P0XZ27,Time Warner cable remote,It is an exact duplicate of my Time warner remote.I bought it so my wife could control the TV from her chair and not ask me to do it every time.It works great.I would reccomend it to anyone.
A9J7RIQ6J8QHL,Great picture.. poor layer switches,"I have had this player for a year and a half now and must say that i have been very pleased with the basic performance of the unit.  The picture is more than acceptable, and the sound is above average for an entry-level  unit.  The problem with the unit is that it has a real problem with layer  switching.  Patton, Matrix, and Nightmare on elm street are three movies  that have all given me problems.  The service from JVC is also poor, and  many of the problems that i have had do not exist according to them.  The  only other problem i had is the remote, which has a joystick the the enter  key incorporated.. so pushing enter can be difficult and annoying.  All in  all.. it's a good entry unit.  But if you want a more consistant player  with better support, you can do better."
AV4N3GV4BC7MY,A Moral and Social Affront to Women,"Perhaps in this society of expensive cars, stereo systems and elaborate in-car cellular phones, &quot;Bulldog&quot; decided that when it comes to car theft protection, the ends justify the means. One of the options for  this car alarm system is a woman's voice crying out &quot;Please help  me.&quot;  In my neighborhood, when I hear a woman saying &quot;Please help  me&quot; it used to be a cause for alarm. People would leave their  apartments and look for the source.  A neighbor of mine recently bought  this system and set the alarm to the &quot;please help me&quot; option.  After about one week of hearing the voice crying for help every time a cat  jumped on the car, or a bus went too close, I stopped really hearing  it.To take this step in CAR protection is disgusting. If the  manufacturers did not think that this option would cause de-sensitization  to the cries of a woman in trouble, they must not have ever had to walk the  dark streets of the city, desperate to get home safely.  This car alarm  shows exactly where our priorities lie.  Any length to protect your car.  What's next?  Crying Babies? Gunshots? Don't buy this product.  If you do,  please, please don't use the &quot;please help me&quot; alarm."
A1B8ZIULQQP3OM,FOR THE LOW PRICE...,"...this is an outstanding little tripod. We have two. I use it with a pretty large digital camera and it balances the camera just fine. My husband uses it with fine results for his shirt-pocket sized camera. The tripod is light enough to hoist over my shoulder for treks into the mountains, but heavy enough to be steady for finicky closeups.The quick release is sometimes a little fussy about popping back on, but it is a quick _release_ (and it works very well at that), not a quick ""snap on"". The legs have been no trouble, at all. It helps that I trained myself to extend the lowest segment first, and then to move up as needed. One will need a mini-tripod because this does not go as low as you might want for some work on the ground. (True confession: I've had good luck jury-rigging the legs for shots on the ground when I haven't wanted the extra weight of a mini.)Unless or until I decide to spend $$$$$ on fancy-schmancy equipment, this works just great for me. I've had it a while and, at the price, would have no qualms whatsoever at replacing it with the same model, if it should break -- which it shows absolutely no sign of doing."
AB8M3RXGSPDFE,GOT MY PC REALLY COOKING,"Since I installed my new memory card, everything just runs so much faster. Even my internet pages come up faster and my downloads are much better."
A309SKO1ELS32B,Good product,I had this one and I has been using it at the church. No problem so far. I like it.
A1KHPQEVMSNZ00,My first backpack,"I recently bought this backpack because I was tired of trying to carry everything in my small camera pack on my shoulder.  Although this backpack isn't huge (didn't want a huge one that would get too loaded up with weight anyway, I have found it to suit my needs.  My two complaints - with a tripod in place on the back (and all strapped in), you cannot get into the smaller back zipped area where the memoriy system is, wihtout taking the tripod off.  In addition - the memory system: Patented?  Why?  It is 2 very small tight pocket that have a color strip  to tell old from new batteries and flash cards.  Big deal.  Maybe only one flash card fits in and the battery memory pocket didn't even fit the 4 AA batteries my camera needs.  I found other places for this gear rather than these small, tight pockets.All in all, a good backpack for the price.  Comfortable to wear and has rain protection if needed.  I did have trouble fitting my Fuji Finefix S602 Zoom in the normal spot, but reconfigured the velcros separators and made it fit.  Not as much other gear would fit after that though, but this camera does not have a lot of additional lenses anyway."
A3EERJGK0VGUM7,Router is good. Linksys support is awful.,"When I bought this router, I used Linksys' support # to configure it. I am on a Mac & was able to call Linksys' support, get through easily, talk to someone in the US who was familiar w/ OSX and connect via my DSL modem without a hitch. I recently upgraded to the WRT54 & tried calling because I couldn't access my router's settings via IE. To my dismay, the person on the other end was not a native English speaker & I had a very difficult time understanding him (I had to ask him to repeat every instruction at least twice). I was uncomfortable sending out my details (phone#, service provider & IP address) to him because of this. As it turns out, he was in India. He also said he knew nothing about OSX & that I should call Apple to find out how to configure my Linksys router.  Well that's helpful. While the new router is considerably cheaper than Apple's base station, I am considering sending it back & paying the difference for Apple's base station because I am so annoyed that Linksys has outsourced its technical support to India, even though my BEFW11S4 has worked fine (as long as i don't have to change settings)."
ALUNVOQRXOZIA,State of the Art Television,"At the present time there is not that much programming in HDTV, but it is  changing fast.  It is limited to broadcast TV.  Jay Leno and Monday Night  Football are the first to come to mind.  At present the digital satellite  dishes don't support HDTV-I'm told they will soon.  Satellite still  provides a better quality signal than cable systems.  It will be 2002  before HDTV is in widespread use.For display purposes this is the best  quality image in a TV you can get.  Is it worth the price?  Not yet  considering limited amount of programming.  In another year the price will  have dropped some and you will be able to take advantage of HDTV quality.If you want to buy a big screen TV now, if you can't wait for Monday  Night Football, then this is the one to buy.  For the best picture quality  get a digital satellite dish, with a local broadcast antenna and this  TV.If you can wait another year, that would be a better time to buy."

A1CYI51AMZET8V,Great little case!!!,"I have a Sony NW-MS9 Network Walkman player (great little thing) and this case works perfectly with it.  Since my MP3 player is so small, I can fit plenty of batteries inside with it.  I like this case very much because when I take my MP3 player out with me, I know that it is safe and it won't get scuffed or scratched.  Some of my friends have this case and they have larger MP3 players than mine and theirs' fit in this case just fine.  If you are looking for a quality case, I suggest you buy this one.  Hope this was of help to you!"
A1UV6C6ZBTTSW,No dice.,"Let me say that it's possible that I received a defective cleaner, but this one actually set me back.  When put into the VCR, it would not complete the 20 second cleaning cycle.  It played for maybe 5 seconds, making a terrible grinding noise, before stopping.  I tried it on two VCRs because I wanted to make sure it wasn't my device, and also I'm a glutton for punishment.  The cleaner did the same thing with the second (and newer) VCR.  Unfortunately it messed up the head on the first VCR, so I'm waiting for another cleaner (NOT a replacement of this one!) to realign it.  Thankfully amazon has a quick and easy return policy.Like I said, it is very possible this was a fluke since I bought it based on the positive reviews...but do be aware."
A3S50UW12B368X,Bushnell Powerview 8x21 compact folding binocular,"Product was ordered for 6 yr. olds.  Good grip size for them, lightweight.  Great quality for the price."
AU6YUO58UAIOP,Blows all others out of the water!,"This is by far the best mp3 cd player I've encountered. The battery life lasts for a very long time and the sound quality is excellent. The screen is easy to read and the controls are easy to use. The unit has been far more reliable than other mp3 cd players I have tried as well.The unit is also flash upgradeable, so Rio will post periodic updates on their website to update the features on the player."
A32MJY7A13S4S9,It broke in nine months,"Given the limited availability of HD programing available, we early adopters of such products must be masochists.  Cleverly (I thought), I bought the extended warranty, just in case.  So, when my digital audio went out 9 months later, I didn't worry too much.  It took me 4 more months to figure out that it was the DCT100, and not the cable or the audio receiver that was bad...  So, 2 stars DCT100 (which was cool, when it worked), and one star..."
A3Q97QFRGXI7IK,It's a clunker,"I owned an ipaq 3150 for about two months before I decided that it was just too big to be practical.  I needed a device that would fit comfortably in my pocket... I guess I figured that I could get by with 16 mb and not need to use the expansion sleeve.  But the memory dissappeared rapidly and I discovered how bulky the thing is with the sleeve on.  Bulky and heavy.  I really enjoyed my use of this PDA, however; the large screen is nice for Ebooks and photos, if you can stand the monochrome display.  If you can get by without the sleeve, the PC itself is quite sleek and attractive.  I bought it in the first place because it seems less expensive than it's color relatives, but recently prices have plummetted and a thinner machine with a color display is no longer unaffordable."
A2FNMIS4GSI59X,Ack!  GRAIN!,"I was not at all impressed with this film.  I shot eight rolls under various conditions with my Nikon N80 and will not use it again.The colors seemed washed out and contrast wasn't there.  However, my main complaint is graininess.  I've seen much smoother images from ISO 1000.Perhaps others may have better results, but I'll be shooting Royal Gold 400 until something better comes along."
A1GCCNAKKTZ27Y,excellent service,Great service from supplier. Received memory card within a view days. Couldn't find this card in stores anymore. Now I can use my Sony camera again. Works great.
A1WKMDL85JLIFM,Good lock,Great lock for the price.  If you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for you.
A2NO9CL6CYXHHB,"simple to use, short range",This product was simple to use as everyone has indicated but the sole purpose was to take group shots and be in the picture.  I had a group shot with 15 people in it and the range was not far enough so I had to use the camera timer instead.  It does attach nicely to the camera strap.  For smaller group photos it's fine.howard
A3PYCSDW0GBT75,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have used these headphones almost everyday for the last 3 years and they still sound great. My only problem is that they are stinky because I use them at the gym, so I need new ones!"
AF9KDI9Q8ZIDQ,A good value for the money.,"This is my first telescope, although I've viewed the night sky with far more expensive scopes.  I'm impressed with the capabilities and value (I paid far less than retail at Costco).I have not had the problem with the scope bumping into the base.  However I do think the az/el drive system could be driven a bit better.  On the highest rate - 9 - it seems to start up rather jerky, neccessitating a switch to a lower rate for short movements.The only problem I've had is with the various types of alignment.  It's hard to use a magnetic compass near the scope, for the quick alignment procedure.  I would attribute this to my lack of experience with the equipment, but it makes it hard to track Mars properly."
A3106L0YDW3DIU,CD Storage sleeves,"For the price these are more than sufficient for how i use them.  Are they the best and most beautiful and in color...no, but I don't need them to be.  I am grateful that Amazon offers them!"
A3OX9B1HS7368L,A good little workhorse.,"I got my first Canon 105 about 3 years ago. Right from the start it delivered sharp clear photos, excellent colour balance and good lights and darks. The composition was always spot on - ie no cropped heads due to misaligned viewfinder. I would take panoramics, people shots, close up animal shots, artistic still-lifes, and abstract closeup plant shots. I took over 100 rolls of film; and took it all over with me, across Europe, America. From dull situations to bright Arizona deserts; it always came out true. I unfortunately got sand in the camera when I took it to Italy; and as a result jammed the lens. I took it in to repair at our local shop but they lost it when it was sent away. I was offered the Yashica 140 as a replacement, and tried it out this weekend. No comparison. The viewfinder in the Yashica was too small; it wouldn't allow me to get too close in my shots to the subject thus compromising the composition I wanted, and when I got the film back; not one of the images was good. Blurry; completely smudged and unrecognisable, some of them; others, which I know would have worked on my Canon, came out either too contrasty, not enough definition in the various areas.  Even straightforward shots of my cat sitting still came out out of focus!  So much for its more advanced and intelligent focus system... it would be nice if it could get the images in focus in the first place. I rang the shop and told them I want a replacement Canon 105. The only gripe I have (and it's a petty one), is the dial method of selecting the options, but it's not as fiddly as trying to get that Yashica's back open to load a film!For a camera that takes excellent photographs that are good enough to enlarge and make an artistic statement, or for family gatherings or mementoes of the pets, personal or semi-professional; the Canon 105 is for me."
A3948O6IHS9X0N,Minolta Maxxum QTsi 35mm SLR Camera w/35-80mm lens,"Our son needed a camera for photo-shop class. Teacher's recommendations were to look in pawn shops. Went to several places but each wanted $150+ for ones that were visibly beat up. Husband looked here on Amazon & gave our son a few choices. Of course he decided on the more expensive one on our list, which was the same amount we would have paid at a pawn shop anyway. But it was no biggie since his b-day was right around the corner! He was excited to go show it off in class. Teacher told him it was a good camera! Son loved it! And we enjoyed each picture he brought home!"
A2FS58UD30MU4K,It Works...,This device works well but I was not thinking it would be mono rather than stereo. With that caveat I would reccommend it.
AE8W6OW6A1M5M,"If you're looking for a PS/2 Mouse, Look No Further","After buying a computer at a thift store, I needed a mouse for it. At a local electronic or stationery store, computer mice are almost always USB. I wanted a PS/2 mouse, so I wouldn't use up my available USB plugs. This was exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. It works great. In fact I'm using it as I type this review."
A2MT8B6SBVFJV8,The worst software to accompany a product,When you order this product take note of other's complaints in regards to the software that comes with this product...comes with one of the most frustrating programs that required mutiple downloads to upgrade and ultimately did not work...so purchase different software or you will be in for lots of frustration and disppointment.
A3YR3GW8VIZEK,Cheap and wonderful,"I was bit confused after reading negative reviews. I received the product and oooh..it is the best..for 9 buck who would give this cable for you?. The build quality the superb. IT records my video beautifully(though i used for a day only) ..I have not got any problem with this. I believe that this is original belkin. I don't care if it is not. Another thing is I checked this cable in local radio shack ($33) and that also did not have belkin name on the cable. Do not worry about whether this is belkin or not. Amazon can not sell duplicate Belkin product so public. So, go ahead and buy it ..no body sells cheaper than this."
A1GB9AUQF3PQMA,Saved My Lens,"I attached this to the front of my Tamron 2.8 17-50mm lens almost two years ago and forgot about it. I didn't realize the beauty and importance of it until an accident that shattered the Tiffen. The important thing though, is that my lens is completely intact because tiffen took the entirety of the impact. I am so thankful I had this little one protecting my lens and am definitely ordering another!"
A3AKB4GVGGWIVI,"Great-to-have, but wrong color.","This would have been a typical 5 star review for this item. Like most people who buy this I have more than one primary area where I use my computer.  I have a Compaq Armada portable and have 2 docking stations....one at home and at work.  I needed 1 cradle for each so I bought the second cradle.  The 2nd cradle loses 2 stars simply because it was the wrong color.  Cradle was gray, while the palm IIIxe and the cradle that came with it, are black. Why?  Be advised cradle received may not match your black Palm IIIxe in color."
A4U8NV8P13RH9,Belkin 3-foot internet cable,Not much to review here. Item was as advertised and worked without problem. The plugs have a guard over the lever which helps keep the snap tab from breaking off.
A3G21SUM0LID5X,Poor W2K Driver -- No Support,"I purchased this product as a second NIC for a Windows 2000 Server.  I like the fact that the DFE-530TX+ was easy to reconfigure for a low-profile PCI slot (it has both full-height and low-profile brackets in the box).Unfortunately when I installed the drivers and rebooted I got the &quot;blue screen of death&quot;.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times per the documentation, I downloaded the latest version, etc. to no avail.So I called tech support.  I waited on hold for 8.5 hours before I gave up the first time.  Altogether I called tech support about 9 times.  2-3 times after drilling down their phone menu the system was silent for a few minutes and then disconnected me.  I never did speak to a tech support person.If the drivers actually work with your OS it may be a good product, but I would certainly avoid it if you're running W2K."
A1U7NHS3YOP4LL,boombox does not play,I got this boombox as a gift about 8 month ago and it does not play any more what must i due in order to make it work.i am not happy with the product
A1RQBMVTDN751T,What a great tracking device.,"I would just like everybody to know, I haven't had any problems with the HandyGPS.  I connect to satellites within a minute. I't tracks me in the car and hiking through the mountains. The latitude and longitude are pretty accurate, alot more than 25 meters, I would say more like 5-10 meters. Just depending on how strong your connection is.  The Ubigo mapping is pretty good, I'm looking forward to the Rand McNally Street Finder Deluxe coming out so that I can do point to point direction. I managed to write with the pencil icon on the map. This created a trail of where I had ventured that day. This is definetly a cool feature. It allows you to name and save it. I'm still experimenting with the HandyGPS but there are so many features it may take a while!"
AK6BWNWBAXS97,Fell apart in the first few minutes.,"Must have had a defective unit, but this thing fell to pieces when I tried to reel the cord in. I was too busy to deal with it so I never sent it back. I tried to fix it but couldn't. Didn't work for me at all."
A2CH2WDQWY1M65,if you're looking for accurate sound...,"this is excellent sound at a great value.  i actually use these headphones for mastering tracks... it would take thousands of dollars in amps and studio monitor speakers to get accurate sound representation like this.Pros:  sound, price, leather bag, screw on plug adapterCons:  heavy on your head, require a lot of power to really knock(and since a good of half of people reading this have an ipod, yes i did try them with mine... it has enough power to drive them pretty well, definitely a useable combo."
A39ZPF6A77LCCQ,Good for PS3,"I keep this guy plugged into my PS3 to charge my remote from the couch when needed and I still want to play the game, lets face it the cord that Sony provides is a joke.  Thiswas actually a replacement since my puppy chewed on the end of the first one I had and since it's so cheap it's a no brainer.  Will buy again if it breaks especially at this price point."
A3P726XPK6THOC,Fired up about firewire,"Great firewire card, it is just what I needed to input video from my camcorder."
A329B6BKTHQ41A,Packaged very securely,Perhaps Amazon has done some retraining of their warehouse crew since the earlier complaints were posted?  My 1TB OEM Seagate Barracuda was packaged very securely inside of foam padding similar to what is found in the packaging for retail Seagate drives.This box was then placed inside of a second box for shipping.It only took 4 business days to arrive via USPS!  Thumbs up to Amazon for their care in packaging of this drive for shipment.
AOYKKDC7B9W48,New versions of this trackball are defective,"I've been using the item for years, but the new ones we've bought for work are obviously defective. The ball performance rapidly degrades, it appears everyone has them on sale. Microsoft should recall this product because of poor manufacturing."
A1Q261WA6VN5TG,out of stock,"you are out of stock,i need a new keyboard.email me if you get it in, or atleast post if you get it in"
A167S4VAXAA1PI,Batteries,The batteries arrived in a timely fashion and was at a price thought to be a good one. thanks
A7F1CJ2VRYOM5,Well Made and Does the Job,This is very sturdy and well made and I'm glad I got it for my cyberstuff that does not require a battery back-upl I recommend this product!
ARHYZGUGQ0GTX,A great set of useful tools,"I use this set for building my pcs and only need a couple other tools outside from it,so it is a nice kit for the price."
A3FWOUFTC7QJU,Great Deal on IPAQ expansion pack,"I ordered this refurb expansion pack with a little hestation; as always one is never quite sure what a refurb will be like. At the price it was offered I couldn't pass it up. Much to my pleasant surprise it showed up packed in an OEM box and could have passed for new! The expansion pack will allow me to extend the life span of this wonderful little machine, which now fills the role of hand-held gaming console, e-reader, mp3 player and video machine. Don't hesitate to purchase one of these if you have the need."
A261LNIKRW9VVM,MISLEADING,"I bought this cable to use as an extra for when I travel. I already own an outlet that allows a usb to be plugged into it, to charge electronics. When I use this cable, my phone posts a message saying this cable is not recommended for this phone and it looks like its charging but I dont think it is. The battery bars never increased when I unplugged it and I plugged my phone into its original verizon cable and it fully charged in less time then I had it plugged into this cable. I'm gonna call or email this seller to see if I can get a refund."
AZMMFZKJB8PV6,Great sound system,"I bought this for my husband to be used for his xbox 360, It sounds very good and can get very loud if desired."
APE5YZBCZAWX,Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse,This is a great product for frequent internet users.  The Optical WheelMouse by Logitech works awesome on both MACs and PCs.  The Optical freedom gives you control on any surface.  The Wheel is great for scrolling all websites and eliminates the hastle of hinding the scroll bar on the screen.  The Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse is also great for both righties and lefties!  The software is no hastle and is up and running in minutes.  I recommend this product to everyone
A113CM90ZHZ2CA,better than trying to stick on those,"protects and allows for function, better than trying to stick on those covers"
A18HMSBP37Q8QO,Worthy - every camera lens should have one.,I am a real believer in expensive lens protection. Filters do this and improve the photos you take. This small starting pack of filters is a good value for both reasons - a no brainer. Don't think about it - BUY IT!
A10FQKYILPOSQM,Work well when it's &quot;working&quot;,"I owned two of these units.  The first one I got had battery problems and even after callibrating it a couple of times the things would play 2 or 3 songs and then die.  Back to the store where I exchanged it for another.The next unit's battery worked but had the common discharge problem if its not used in a week.  The volume control on the unit was a little finiky.  If you didn't press on the control in the right place the sound just didn't change up or down.In general I wonder about the quality control Rio has because from reading othe sites and reviews they seem to have issues.I wrote them about getting the replacement charger, submitted my info and support never got back to me and never replaced the charger. So much for good support.Pros-All my MP3s splayed perfectly on the unit.-Random and Repeat worked fine.-The weight and size was also acceptable.-Comes with a belt clipCons-Throw out the headphones, absolutely useless and they hurt the head.-Software that came with it sucked. Windows media player worked OK but had the occasional crash where the media player would not longer recognize the unit.-Overall poor quality.-Crappy support.I gave the unit 2 starts out of 5 because over the two years I had it working I was sorta happy with it. Then recently this unit just stopped working.  It's the battery the playback was messed up and all you could here was sound in MONO or something.  So that's it for Rio.I can't recommend you get one. I'm moving to a mini-disc player and recommend you do the same."
A3VJAU9FIDMB8N,Excellent Headphones For $70!!!,"Like many here, I did a lot of research before purchasing the V6.  I considered the 7506 but I usually take good care of my electronics so I didn't want to pay the extra $15 for it.  Anyway, I just want to write a review as there are some questions that I wished were answered before purchasing. Before I start, I want to let people know that this is my first over the ear headphone.  I always use earbuds due to it portability.  I run with them so the V6 isn't ideal in that situation. Okay, now the review.The product:It is very well made, no cheap plastic parts.  The wires are long and good for sitting in one place to listen to your music, esp from a receiver.  If you have to walk around while holding your portable music player like my zune hd, then it can be a handful to hold bc you will need to carry the cord around along with your music player.  Not a big deal, but just a heads up if you are looking for something a little more portable and manageable.  I have been using this for a couple of days now and the earpieces hurt my ears after an hour of use.  People said it will get better.  I only hope so, but I bought a Beyerdynamic replacement because I heard it is more comfortable and that it will make the music even better too.  I also heard the original earpiece won't last very long.  My other complaint of the original earpiece, like others have stated, is that my ears get warm after 15 minutes of use and becomes sweaty.The music:I have used $30 sony earbuds and $60 klispch earbuds before and I have to say that this definitely sounds better.  The lows are deep, the mids are excellent, and the highs are very clear.  The biggest difference between this and my other earbuds is the clarity of the music, especially the vocal. I don't know if the earbud's small single driver or its proximity from inside the ear canal that is causing the sound to be muddy, but this over the ear headphones make the music sound more natural and clear.  I used to love a lot of bass in my music and I still do as I listen to Trance often. If you are looking for a headphone with booming overpowering bass, then this might not be for you.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the loudness of the bass when I first listened to Tiesto or Hip Hop music.  I am not saying that the bass isn't good, it is very good, very deep.  It's just not eardrum breaking. =P. For alternative, pop, and other music that emphasize vocals and a dynamic range of bass and treble, this headphone performs brilliantly.  You can hear all the different instrument being played very clearly. It actually made me fall in love with the vocal of one of my favorite female singer. ^_^ If your MP3 conversion isn't great, then you can hear all the crackles and static. I don't know if that is a good thing or bad.  One thing I noticed is that I needed to turn up the volume a little more compared to my earbuds to hear the music on the same loudness level.  I think perhaps portable music player like my zune HD requires a bit more power for the headphone compared to earbuds.  I usually listen to my zune HD at level of 18-20, but with the V6, I listen between 20-23. I love music and this headphone has taught me to appreciate it even more.  I have learned to love the quality of the music now, and not just the loudness of the bass.  As for noise cancellation, it does reduce outside noise by about 33% IMO but there is no noise cancellation, passive or active. You can hear outside noise without music turned on.Update after a month of use:Music still sounds great.  Only problem I have is that the earpiece is so uncomfortable.  They press against my ears and hurt a lot after an hour of use.  It also gets very sweaty too.  Please keep this in mind before deciding your purchase."
A25HBO5V8S8SEA,How many pictures will it store?,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 256MB CompactFlash Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs."
A1BHZPN2HD8CXJ,NICE,"Nicely made, smooth movement.  No obvious workmanship flaws or glass imperfections.  Makes for rich coloring, as expected.  Wonderful.  No hesitation in recommending this reasonably priced polariser."
A1HQT2ITGN2WRA,"grade it..... c+, you get what you pay for.","I am an amatuer. Tri-pod is fairly stable and fairly fluid moving. OK for average home-user. There is a fair amount of play in the head (especially at high zoom), before the ""fluidity"" takes effect. At high zoom, the followed, framed subject drifts off (back to it's ""zero""), when you take your hand off of cam. Maybe I have a poor one!!??"
AK95OSSDTLPQ8,I've found what I've been looking for in a photo album,I was upset that I accidentally ordered 5 x 7 prints and I didn't realize it till after I picked up my order.  The photos were too big to fit into my other albums so I had to get something new.  I found this Pioneer Ledger to be great.  It was exactly what I was looking for - it had to fit 5 x 7 photos and it had to look semi decent (well...this one turned out to look pretty good).  I got my album today after ordering it only 2 days ago and I immediately put all my photos in it.  The photos were easy to insert.  I highly recommend it. :-)
A2BNHVB08ZO4XL,Does the job,"I'm not sure if it's only the filter that I received, but mine arrived with dust on both sides of the glass and the glass was not sitting tight in the ring, it's loose, slightly moves.But it does the job now, so I don't think that I'll return it."
A2OP2SRRY8NV1W,Incredible piece of work,"I first got a cable modem and then we bought a new computer no less than a week later.  We wanted to share the connection, but couldn't decide on what path to take.  I then heard about this product, from my uncle who had DSL.  He said it had been working fine and he loved it.  So i picked one up, and within about 15 minutes, I had everything running perfectly with no problems whatsoever.  This is the best networking hardware I have ever seen, with it, you can share your DSL/cable connection, and even better, the computers that are networked with this can share files at 100Megabits/sec!"
A24UO453L5VLI2,Terrible performance,From the very first time I put this in my PC it didn't work as it should. Tech support was useless. DO NOT purchase this junk!!
A293HFUVSRYX73,Will NOT work on Win XP,"Be advised that this will not work on Windows XP and the D-Link website is less than helpfull for support on this.  Although, I was able to make this work on my other PC which is a Windows(ME) machine, without any problems.  If you are looking for a cheap and easy way to capture video this is it."
A15AVV8I83IWW0,good and cheap,"This is a very good headphone for listening and djing. Even though it hasn't many articulations, the sound is very good."
A2QDYDMCPU68U5,Great easy to install mount,One of the easiest TV mounts to install.  This works on several standard TV mounting patterns and has a &#34;quick release&#34; to put on or take off the TV.  Well worth the money!
A1Z7U9K6X3FEOU,YES!,"I like these little headphones! They're lightweight and the sound they put out is quite substantial.  Not super-high end audio-snob substantial, but good enough to watch an action movie or edit some footage without costing an arm and a leg. I like the feeling of not having to baby them. So far they've held up, but if I do break them, I'm not too worried. $6.44 and I'm back in business 2 days later.  5/5 would recommend."
A2F6WVHWNU47OW,Olympus 2100 - An Excellent Value!,"I recently purchased the Olympus 2100 camera after considering many alternatives.  Here is what I like: Image stabilization and an all-glass 10X optical zoom means that the 2.1 meg pictures usually look better than any 3 meg camera. Great vide clip ability with sound that remains sychronized with the action. [A] Rebate if you buy Olympus accessories. Menu and controls are very easy to use - spend 1/2 hour with the manual and you'll be ready to go. Great battery life - I've shot about 100 pictures and a dozen video clips using the LCD display and I'm still on my original charge. This camera has the option of continuous focus - I usually lock the focus (1/2 press of shutter) at athletic events and then take the picture when the action happens.  I had been concerned about slow response times of digital cameras (vs. traditional), but this camera works great in capturing the action when I want. Overall, I'm very happy with this camera.  My only complaint is that the camera body is silver (instead of black).  Other than that, it has completely exceeded my expectations.  Buy a card, a reader, and another set of batteries and you're all set!"
A2ILKUTFTX35B6,great!,"i was doing some research for some good headphoens to use to listen to music when i'm relaxing or studying and i was skeptical about this at first because no one had ever commented on it before. i first bought sony monitor headphones and they HURT! i just put them on and had to take them off right away and didn't even try it with music on... then i shopped around and figured that maxwell headphones shouldn't be that bad because my college doesn't sell a variety of headphones and only sell the ones that actually sell and maxwell's were one of them. i went to staples to get some supplies and actually saw ONE maxwell headphones left and they were also only priced for a total of $30 and so i decided to give it a try. when i took it out and tried it first before the music, it was really comfortable! when the music, it really has a nice sound and does drown out the noise around you EVEN WITH/ WITHOUT the batteries for the noise cancellation. i would recommend this pair of headphones to anybody who loves a bargain and also comfort and sound w/o the hinderance of performance just for the price. it even is compact and includes a pouch for it! how convenient especially since it also includes plugs for the airplane...for anyone who needs to travel..."
A1G9SOE51HET8E,Excellent toy and tool for children,"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it."
A35XQ9UR843RM0,Canon Wireless Remote,I have been unable to test the remote as well.  I thought my batteries were dead and went out and replaced them.  It still doesn't work and now it is past the &#34;deadline&#34; to return the product.
ADO0BUYYJVC6U,Fixes for 5435 hangup problems,"Like many of the reviewers here, I had slow connections androuter hang ups with the 5435 router.  However, the verylatest firmware release (1.41.0009) has apparently fixed allof the problems I've had.  Previously, I had to reboot therouter after 2 days of work; now it has been running nearly aweek, with my doing things that always hung the router before.So, if you have an SMC 7004AWBR model 5435, and have beenhaving hanging or slow connection problems, give firmware 1.41.0009 a shot.  It took them forever to get the biggestproblems fixed, but it has made a world of difference to my system."
A3SV9PIMIBAHBE,Didn't match with Canon,"It is written that will match with Canon cameras but was loose in my Canon 50D. Unfortunately ,it is not refundable."
A27WE8BLO92HGW,"Failed in less than 2 years, I'm lucky it didnt ruin my TV","This was my most expensive surge protector.  I bought it to protect my brand new 63"" plasma.  For a while it worked fine, but then it started to short out and got to the point where the cable box turned off.  Not wanting to risk damaging my TV, I moved it for use with a simple lamp and phone.  A couple weeks later it started whistling and then turned off completely.  I never had a surge protector do that before and cringe at the thought of the damage it could have done to my plasma.  Stay away from this company."
A11Y9IR66PVXMB,PortaPro great for the money with some minor flaws,"I just bought the PortaPros a little while ago and I have to say that I really do love these headphones. They are some of the best sounding headphones I have heard rivaling my Bose Over-Ear's. Some problems some folks might have with these headphones are portability, sound leak and style. Although these roll up into a ball for better portability, if you are student like me who has to stuff them in their backpack before class it becomes a problem unless you buy a case like I did, in my case it was a little sandwich box which did the trick. In terms of sound leak, they do leak sound a lot which caused concern at first and still does, however I have found that I can turn up the volume loud enough to hear very well and low enough so others can't hear. Other than that I love these headphones and for $30 and a lifetime warranty I would suggest them to anyone."
A3B1R7UFNS70GL,"Cheap and effective, but nosiey.","I'll keep this short and to the point. This fan is cheap and will move a lot of air, and for some people that is great. However, it is noticeably loud.  If your computer already has a lot of fans, then this probably won't bother you. However, if you are used to your computer being quite and just wanted to add extra ventilation, then spend the extra money and get a more expensive fan that will not be so noisy."
A1WOZKE39N90UK,Best Everyday Lens for Your Sony Alpha DSLR,"When I bought my Sony Alpha 200 camera, I loved everything about it except the lens that came with it.  The 18-70mm takes decent pictures, but it is light and plastic feeling, and the overall zoom length is just not enough.  I don't use the wide angle near as much as the telephoto, so it was definitely a bummer of a lens for me.  So I went on a hunt to get a good all around everyday lens.... I tried the Minolta 50mm f1.7 and it is great in low light in doors, but not as versatile as a zoom.  Most of the normal zoom lenses were 28-85mm, or 28-105mm, etc.  Then I found the SONY 24-105mm lens and it looked like just the thing---- till I saw the $549 price tag. I read that the Sony 24-105mm was really a re-release of a ""D"" series Minolta lens no longer made.  All the reviews said that the older Minolta 24-105mm was a solid performer with gorgeous color. That started the hunt for a good copy of the Minolta 24-105mm lens, and I found one that was only 9 months old.  THIS IS EVERYDAY LENS YOU WANT FOR A SONY ALPHA.  F3.5-4.5 is better than the usual f4-5.6 on most third party normal zoom lenses.  THE WIDE ANGLE IS STILL GOOD AT 24MM, BUT THE PORTRAIT LENGTH 105MM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY 152MM IN 35MM PHOTOGRAPHY) IS JUST THE THING TO REACH OUT THAT LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE STOCK LENS.  THE LENS IS COMPACT, AND COMES WITH A PETAL BAYONETTE HOOD.  The 62mm filter size is easy to find good filters at a reasonable price.  AT $252 THIS WAS THE BEST ADDITION TO MY SONY ALPHA TOOLS.  If the 24-105mm Sony ever drops to $250 then I would consider it.  This lense has great color, solid feel, no zoom creep.  It's Outstanding!"
A2G8DGQ8CHJUQM,It was a gift for my grandson.,"He used it a few weeks and it didn't work after that. He had to return it and they sent him another one. As far as I know, this one is working fine. I know initially he enjoyed using it."
A3MCQ0649ZC70A,Fantastic,"I have a Perma- Focus for about 22 years and now I wanted one for my wife. This bino is perfect, exactly what I wanted. I definately reccomend it to anyone."
AQRVAPQYGNHYF,Best ergoboard ever made!,"When you get used to these, there's no going back!  Best keyboard ever made and it's a shame they're so hard to find."
A10IZ1RKIMM7AB,Works Great!!,Use in my jeep with a permanent antenna. Great range and sound and can remove from vehicle with ease. Very pleased!
A2J3VCGBNDLAKF,Why can't Canon make this eycup to stay on?,This is like my 4th eyecup for my Canon 5D mkII. The eyecup just slides off too easily and later you pick up your camera and it is gone. Thinking about putting some rubber cement or something to hold it in place but not be permanent.
A1LLACL82ZONMN,E-smile Digital Camera,The Agfa e-smile digital camera is not too bad for the pricebecause once you know HOW to use it correctly it really does takedecent pics.If you want a digital camera just for putting pics on webpages or sending e-mail pics to friends and family this is good for that. Camera can be used for video conferencing and can be hooked to vcr or tv to capture real time video imagaes I was ready to take it back but now I can use it for E-mail just fine just don't expect to get above average pics with this camera.  END
A1LVEEG5AI2RXV,It didn't work!,"Can you imagine buying an extension cord and it didn't work.  Also, it is apparent the price was increased to cover the shipping so that the shipping would be ""free.""  I bought a replacement locally for half the cost of the one that didn't work."
A3BAP5X00R6BIJ,Good headphones,"really I don't see why these deserve anything less than a 5 star, so that's what I'm going to give.I like how tight these headphones are and the fact that other people can't hear anything you're listening to, even at full volume. The sound isn't perfect, but it's good enough. And they look very cool ;)"
A20DLQSQE4BBTH,VERY POWERFUL AND USEFUL FOR THE PRICE !,The Delkin USB Smartmedia reader and writer is very useful to transfer data from/to your computer to/form another computer. I use it this way because all is much smaller and reliable (the cards and the USB reader) compared to ZIP or 128 MB 3.5&quot; floppy drive. NO NEAD TO CLEAN YOUR DRIVE ANY MORE AND YOU CAN TAKE BOTH THE READER AND CARDS IN YOUR POCKETS.
A252HQ9G2O6UWC,Better then I thot,"I got the Rio PMP300 player about 7 months ago. I love it, and use it every day. I have all of my favorite music on it, since it is so easy to get. I dont need to buy CD's any more, and it's saving me alot opf money.  Its small size allows me to bring it ANYWHERE i want, including school."
A16ID6ER6NINWU,Headphones,The Headphones are worth the money. They have a real good Bass sound. I like that they are light weight.
A3CEW1WASKH1LE,Casio Blows their lead,"Casio, a leader in retail electronics and one of the first on the market with the Pocket PC (windows CE) device has sadly let their lead slip away.  They remain the most expensive of the Pocket PC's and it's darned near impossible to find accessories.  I have a Cassiopeia Pocket PC which I will keep but if I had it to do again, I'd save a hundred bucks and buy an HP or Compaq Pocket PC.  Same quality, better price, and easy to find goodies like keyboards and cases."
A3GZ6XQAISJQO5,Sony Headphones,Amazing quality for the value. Would have given it 5 stars but because of my personal preference of liking things a little bit more bassy. Again its not a design flaw on their part but more of a preference thing for me.
A327TGBFKPZOSP,Great Value These Headphones are Sick!!,"I bought these headphones after alot of research. Looking at the specs on all brands, models, and types I couldnt find a better deal than the MDR-VR700DJ's. Me and a friend were messing around and compared these headphones to his Beats Pro(which run about $400) and these headphones kept up(to an extent). All in all you cannot beat the value here, they sound great, are comfortable, and cost under $100. What more could you ask for?"
A3ETIGLNQ685RR,Amazing,This is my second Olympus camera. My first I paid over [dollar amount] for a few years ago.It was the D600l and was a great camera. I bought the Ultra Zoom for close up pictures of animals. I keep amazing my friends with pictures of animals with the Ultra Zoom and for the price its a real bargain for what you get. You even get a cam corder feature that is great. I have used it in various conditions and its performed in every situation. And believe me I take allot of pictures and the quality is great.
ACYJ8CBX52FTG,The Truth about these Headphones...,"I'm a drummer and have been involved with music - in some form or fashion - for more than 40 years. One of my current gigs involves playing a drumset enclosed within a sound booth. Isolation headphones are an absolute necessity in this setting. My old headphones were well worn and I did do a good bit of research for a replacement pair. Most ""pro"" studio headphones are $150+ and I didn't want to drop that much for them. When I saw the Koss QZ-99's, read the reviews (most of which were good), and saw the price (forty bucks even - shipped - on Ebay)- I decided to give them a try. Well, they are rather suitable for my purposes - they do a fair job cutting the background noise - are decently constructed with metal supports rather than the soon-broken plastic used on most of today's headphones - and will probably hold up well. They fit snuggly - perhaps just a bit too snuggly - but, again, that is desirable for my purposes. I don't want them flying off while I'm playing. So - they do fill a need for me - and relatively inexpensively compared to most other options.Now for the bad news - the sound quality from these headphones is mediocre at best and they can be uncomfortable to wear. Bass response is very poor - and if you try to accentuate the bass, you'll get an annoying rattle in both earpieces. Since the sound elements can't keep up, I really don't believe they would hold up long with boosted-bass settings. The treble also seems just a bit clipped... I'd characterize the sound as slightly ""muddy"" in general. These are by no means ""audiophile"" quality headphones - I've had inexpensive headphones from discount stores that could easily match - and, in some cases, exceed - the sound quality of the Koss QZ-99's. Almost all but the smallest heads out there will probably find them too tight (and a bit too heavy) for prolonged wearing without discomfort. As the Amazon description states - these might be ""ideal for use with racing scanners and metal detectors"" - but they are by no means for the casual and comfortable listening of music.One thing that seriously disturbs me reading some of the other reviews here is how often these are promoted for use when using power tools and equipment. By no means should you be listening to music - or other audio sources - while operating chainsaws, mowers, power saws, etc. Doing such is simply beyond stupid and can be quite dangerous to you - and to those around you. Certainly you should make every effort to protect your hearing with passive (non-speaker) headphones or earplugs when exposed to loud equipment - but you certainly don't need your attention distracted by music.So - I'm relatively satisfied with these for my intended purposes (studio isolation) and they would likely be a tolerable match for metal detectors and even for scanners on race day. However - if you buy them solely to listen to music and expect to have a pleasant and comfortable experience - you're very likely to be very, very disappointed..... and if you plan to use them while operating potentially-dangerous power equipment - you are a complete moron...."
A26VMUULL2363Z,Fast and consistent,"I ordered this when the D-LINK router I had kept having streaming buffering.  Amazon sent it quickly, and it was a snap to get up and running.  It has encryption, and no stream buffering!!  There was a rebate coupon on the Internet as well, so net cost was VERY nice!  Whatever model you get, get Linksys- friends and colleagues alike say it's the best, and this one is."
A22KL8CWNG5E36,Not worth the money,"This was purchased as a gift for my mom who has a hard time dealing with a regular remote after her strokes.  Spent a good hour or so 'training' the thing to our voices.  Don't know why - it would just change channels in the middle of a show and when you tried to tell it the station you wanted, it wouldn't change.  So for all that training - it didn't seem to hear a difference in voices and any sound apparently will trigger it to take an action."
AL6PB6GASTWI0,Great Underwater Camera,We took this camera to Punta Cana with us on vacation. It takes perfect underwater photos. Doesn't take good regular pic ...so only use it underwater and you'll be happy
A1HGCIQJ0FY387,Ouch!!!,"Do not buy this if you have Windows XP.  I bought the camera for my children because it sounded perfect for them.  I was fooled by the Windows XP downloads available on the products website.  I spent 2 days installing, uninstalling, trying to contact the company, and searching their help database.  Nothing worked.  So I have nothing good to say.  (Their phone number is disconnected.)When I bought the camera my expectations were low.  I understand you get what you pay for.  After all it was only for my kids to play with.  But I did expect it to at least work.  It failed at that."
A11EDWYLPC7RQH,Amazing,This is amazing. I am very new to the DSLR photography but it has changed my photography experience. Love it!!!
A3HIF15WN70K97,OK Lens,I like the lens as long I don't require a flash. for some reason it doesn't always work if I need to use the flash it will not auto focus.
A31KZC9KTMPQCJ,Bargain price for a slightly outdated gadget,"I got a couple of these as gifts and tested them right out of the box. As others have mentioned none of them would work without the charger plugged in. However removing the batteries and cleaning the terminals usually worked. I was able to massage two of the three cybikos to life this way, with battery life averaging 4-5 hours. With the third cybiko the batteries were so severely corroded that cleaning had no effect whatsoever.The Cybiko itself is slightly outdated but for the low price of $10 you can't go wrong. Cybiko's website is still running and there are a ton of games to download for those who willing to find them. Its also very durable and can stand up to quite a bit of bashing. However, there is no doubt it is a &quot;toy&quot; and will never replace a palm in terms of funcitonality. For the geek-minded you can download a full-fledged SDK to write your own progs, but don't expect to find a burgeoning community of developers."
A1EH2S92FHWZRP,Ten years old and still working perfectly,"I can't believe this can still be reviewed.  I don't have much to say, but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over.  I know.  The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly.  I don't think I have even charged it in a few years.  This thing is amazing in its longevity."
A30GQO8PLSUX85,Incorrect cable.,"This data cable does not work with the T-mobile G2 phone.  Either that, or the seller, 'A Days Tech' sent me the wrong cable."
A2TI9DNKSZ3G72,Works well and saved us money,"We connected this Comm-switch ahead of our phone system, and used the distinctive ring feature (from the phone company).  The device detects the special ring and routes the call to our fax machine, just as advertised.  This line also contains DSL, and all is working fine.Great price on Amazon, and this device saves us the cost of a separate phone line, about $40/month total."
A2YG5GKMAMTIGZ,Exactly what I expected,"I got what I expected and love it, but the one flaw is the length.  I dont need the extra length but someone else might."
A1OO2SELSSU128,Fantastic!,"This is my second pair and I have nothing but good things to say!  Comfortable, good bass depth and very durable. Volume control is a huge plus, especially in the workshop which is where I am most of the time."
A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,Absolutely Get This Quality Cable,"Don't try to save a buck by getting a cheaper cable.  Some cables are very thin, like the one I got with my SanDisk MP3.  The Belkin cable is the real thing.I use this cable to connect the male stereo single plug-ins of my MP3 (SanDisk Sansa Clip) to my boom box. I'm very happy with the way it works.Anywhere it calls for either a 1/8"" stereo or a 3.5mm stereo cable, this Belkin cable is going to work.  It is well worth the price, and you can't get it for less anywhere else as far as I can tell.This is a rare product that I endorse by saying, if it's the correct cable for your connection, don't think anymore but just get it.  Really."
A2XLHLKJS6R15H,Paws,"the price was great amd the quality was good, and I like the paw print designs"
A3SP7NBT6ZGECH,Card is out of date as is the driver support,I purchased this product around 2001 and it was good at the time. I wanted to use it in a new computer running Vista.  When I tried to get Vista drivers I found that there were non available and not even ones for XP for card versions beyond 1.0.  Look at the date on the positive reviews they are  in the early 2000's  It probably was a good product then.
A325SZRS5BLTEY,a few scratches on one of the filter i brought.,"i bought 2 filter at the same time, one for me and the other for a friend. a few scratches on one of the filter, which i kept. the other one was great."
APGD5MGXNUT6D,A Good Value,"I've had these phones for about 2 weeks now and I find them comfortable, quiet (blocking external noise), and good sounding. The sound seems to me to be quite neutral from low to high and their efficiency is pretty good so my computer sound card drives them easily to good volumes. I was concerned about this because of the 64ohm load they present but they are better than my old Sennheiser 580s (32ohm but lower sensitivity) in this regard.I was also concerned about their fit since I had read many people found the hd280s to be too tight. However, they fit me well and I wear them for hours at a time while working on my computer. For me, they are a good compromise of performance, comfort, and price. I rate them highly."
A1MGMWUYRG0MMW,EXCELLENT camera,"I don't agree with the person who said it's too heavy.  Compared to a 35mm camera it's very light.  Besides, what other digital camera offers 3x optical zoom, a microdrive bundle that lets it store ~250 highest quality  pictures (or thousands at lower res/quality), great controls, good battery  life, breathtaking images, and fast upload (USB) to the computer, at this  price?  Nikon?  Sorry, can't use a microdrive.  Canon?  Lots of complaints  about image quality.  Kodak?  Great color, but no 3 megapixel model yet and  slooow operation - plus the DC290 is bigger than this Casio.Casio is not  a respected name in cameras (yet) but this model is an aggressively priced  state of the art entry."
A3PDNV30IFOUBT,Very good,"This is the first photo backpack I've ever had, and I'm impressed.  The quality is obvious.  It holds as much as I think I'd care to have on my back, and you can configure the dividers as you wish - it's very versatile.  No regrets on this."
A2N7PWCMIZHH9S,Great sound!,For an inexpensive headset they have a great sound. I use them on a little Walkman radio and the sound is great.  I've not had many headsets so I'm not an expert but I like the sound that comes from this unit.
A29BCHQA5OBPZX,I Like it; I Like! (Standard Stuff),"I'm about to build a (temporarily) top of the line PC, and I've been slowly buying pieces, over the last six months. Before I bought this kit, I had a magnetized phillips head mini screwdriver, which worked, but the length and magnetism made it less than ideal, for working inside a computer.With this kit, I have comfortable length (which is most apparent when attaching a motherboard). I usually only use the largest phillips head screwdriver, and the three prong tool is awesome. Occasionally I've dropped a small screw, and the prong tool is perfect, for retrieving dropped items from tight spaces.I already had a 00 phillips, for my Macbook. I haven't even tested the fitting of this set's screwdriver. The numbering suggests that it's the same size.I'll probably never use the chip clamp.I do wish there was an antistatic wristband included, or, at least a holder (as another reviewer suggested).My tools were black, not orange....but, overall, awesome kit...more than I needed.UPDATE: Even the smallest phillips head is a little too large for a Macbook. You may be able to make it work, but you would have to bear down on it hard and risk stripping the head."
A240M3IVP8HR0L,solid - wired - but couldn't enter [ unneeded] password,"I wanted a basic solid, wired unit.  This wireless craze is nothing but problem - and too much radiation anyway.  It's plug and play, no software required, unless you need the security of a password.  Don't need it with a wired family network.  That's one less quirk to worry about.Bought a wireless Netgear for less money before this and could not get pass word software to work on that either and could not turn off wireless feature.Otherwise this works fine and fast, so I'm leaving well enough alone.  Had to reset (turn it off and on again) once in two weeks because I tried to back out of a secure socket situation.  Don't know if it was this router that was at fault.  But resetting the router fixed it."
A23VGBG17K5NJ3,A Must-Have Accessory,"If you plan on taking any photos requiring longer exposure times (particularly ""bulb-mode"" photographs in which the shutter remains open until you close it), you need this accessory for your camera.Though the cord is shorter than would be desired, a quick trip to any electronics store should provide a simple solution in an extension: a 3/32"" stereo extension cord, or a 1/8"" cord with adapters to 3/32"".  As these can be had for well under $10, you can easily extend the reach of the shutter release beyond what Canon provided."
ADAAXJNRTTX0D,Handy Addition,"I've been using GPS for over a year, and I've found that I get the most enjoyment from it when it's strapped to my bicycle. This attachment makes getting the GPS on and off a snap. I have found no problems with it to date. In fact, I've made the mount that replaces the battery cover a permanent replacement. The mount attachment/battery cover even fits in my GPS protective case ( asin B00004VX39 )."
AXBJX6JSVKWQ2,Remote Shutter Control,This remote was of very poor quality. It rarely worked.  I sent it back.Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 for Digital Rebel
APNJKJ8OE9WH0,Exactly what we wanted,"This set of binoculars performs as it said it would, and was a fantastic purchase for the price."
AI9AO21GO52VH,Excellent bang for the buck,"The Garmin GPSMap 76 is a nicely thought out and solidly built device that works great if you're willing to learn how to use it.  It has super-sharp graphics, a fair amount of detail, good satellite reception and accuracy, and nice additional features like tidal and sun rise/set information.  Oh, and it's waterproof and it floats.  I've had mine a few months and have gotten good use out of it while driving around northern California and city hiking in San Francisco, and i'm just starting to look at geocaching.This should be obvious to most people but, for the price of this unit, you are not going to get a GPS that puts your seat belt on and gives you turn-by-turn directions in your choice of voices.  You have to be a bit of a gadget-head (or, at least, not a gadget-phobe) to figure out how to use all of the 76's features like navigation or the surprisingly detailed trip computer.  The menu-driven UI is rather terse and doesn't have built-in documentation.  Luckily, the GPSMap 76 allows you to work in simulator mode so you can put it through all of its paces from your living room.The 8Mb RAM does seem light, but GPS Mapquest format must be very efficient in storing data, because that actually works fine for most localized uses.  If you travel around a lot and want to keep two or more locations memory-resident, you might begin to feel the pinch.  As others have mentioned, some of the stored topo and location data is rather high-level and you can spend ~$90 for a CD set that will provide more detail.  That seems to me to be a reasonable price-performance investment.The only thing i've found in this unit that i would consider a bug is that  the user has to tell it what time zone to use.  I would think that it would figure that out based on its location.  Minor detail, though.  One other thing -- the 76 doesn't come with a carrying case so you're out a little more money buying a pouch for it.  Great deal for the money though, and a solid product overall."
A152CGV94KJX5I,Great little thing,I dont use it a lot but when i do i am satisfied every single time.wonderful little product
A2B6LJ1RXA3DBH,Great buy!,"Read review from a photographer and decided to give it a try. Guess what, for the price, excellent quality bag. Fast ship too."
A4JE7XXLGB98P,"Great camera, great pictures!","I found the camera easy to use out of the box and the quality of the pictures to be very good, 8 X 10&quot; come out great in high resolution modes. I was especially impressed with how good it shoots in low light situations. The rechargeable battery is very good, but buy an extra. The same goes for the memory stick, you really need to invest in the larger capacity memory sticks, I found a need for 3 when on vacation.Problems: The LCD is hard to read in bright sunlight (common to all) but you still have an eye viewer - that's good. Next there is a delay time between pressing the shutter and the actual taking of the picture (you get used to this) and secondly the recycle time between pictures is a few seconds, so rapid fire shooting is not possible.I have also switched this camera to &quot;black and white&quot; mode for outdoor scenery shots and it works very well. With easily obtainable software, like Adobe Photo Shop, you can change the contrast and brightness easily for more striking effects. When taking normal color photos you can also enhance contrast and colors to enhance or exaggerate for some great &quot;artistic&quot; effects. I then use a well known HP printer for $200 or less and get great photo prints when using their high quality glossy or matte photo paper."
A21AOHWYUQ3QEY,Works Like a Charm,"I've had this wireless router for about six months and haven't had a single issue.  It runs three computers, two with Windows XP and the other with Windows ME. Set-up was pretty easy, although it did take a call to customer support to figure out how to work around some cable modem issues. I've been very happy with the throughput, although I'm never too far from the base station."
AGNCKEMD9TKA3,Great Deal!,"Once I was able to get DSL, I wasted no time getting the wireless Linksys router.  It was easy to install and I can't find anywhere in my home where I can't get a decent signal.  If you're looking for a wireless router, this is definitely the way to go."
A3OTD5E0CNQK98,I have been using this for almost a year now,Its been over a year and this little speaker set still kicks but.

A2RDQJNHSFDY12,Works Great for any CF application,I use this CF in my Canon S300.  It works great.  The speed is just as fast as the supplied 8mb Canon CF.  I also use this CF as a portable disk drive to transfer large files from one computer to another.  I haven't had any problems with this product.  Plus the price is very reasonable.

A1HYARKC1T498J,CHeap price and it works well.,THe price was right and the thing works as I expected it to. I had a bad volume control on my computer speakers and bought this and some cords to replace it. It works like a charm.
A3J5KBAO5TEZ98,Five Stars,Exactly what I needed
A1CC1XN4WA32EM,Great player...if it works,"I ordered a Rio over a month ago.  When I first got it there was a strange glitch in the sound, certain frequencies seemed almost completely cut out (in the vocal range) which led to some terrible sounding music.  It sounds like at least one other person here had the same problem.  Other than this the player was great, everything I wanted and more.  The sound was even very good, within the range that it could play.Long story short: due to the fact that I ordered directly from SONICblue it took 20+ days for me to get a return authorized and I didn't want to go through this again.  Hopefully the Nomad II MG that's on the way turns out better."
ASPN95ORQQDS0,Perfect for rooting and cyanogenmod,"Rooted, and cyanogenmod installed, works awesome.  The Nook Tablet has a bit more memory than the original Nook Color, so that's why I got this one."

A34S0FQAI0OYNP,Muddy bass,"Positive aspects: Does stay in your ears, affordableNegative aspects: *MUDDY* bass, unbalanced soundOVERALL: Not recommended."
A2YPYZ0LODLTLT,Fantastic sound and great performance.,"It was between the Nomad II MG, the Nike PSA 120 or souped up PSA60, and the Rio 800.I chose the Rio for the quality, the hipness, and the one time fee of having plenty of memory and a rechargeable battery.The downside is the price seems steep for a high end Walkman, and the additional unique memory packs make me feel like a sucker - until the price comes down.The battery charges very quickly and all the features work very well. The bass is strong and the sounds are crisp, especially with the best made MP3s off Napster. And the prices for used Rios on Ebay make me handle the longer term prospects of getting an upgrade.Please note that Intel has a 128mb player coming out soon for 299. It seems like it has everything, but it doesn't look nearly as cool as the Rio 800. The headphones say &quot;Intel&quot; largely on the sides. And I like a little more rebellion and to be cooler when I listen to music.The Rio 800 software has some bugs that make organizing MP3s a minor hassle. However, the USB transfer is fast. I do know that the software that Creative issues for the Nomad is far better.And if you want the Rio for jogging, buying a Nike PSA 60, with an additional 64mb of memory(making it 96MBs), and getting a rechargeable battery and charger will lead you to an equal price to a Rio 800. It is just not as simple as the Rio 800.For the newcomers like myself to MP3 players, I am very pleased with the Rio 800. It is a solid product that I know will have continual value for working out, jogging, and be a great companion for your music needs on the go."
A1O1YOLR5RC7R6,Piece of Junk,"This is the 2nd RCA box I have been through in the last 9 months.  Granted it is not the most [costly] one around, so I guess you get what you pay for these days.  I would recommend getting a midrange (price) of one of RCA's competitors products.  It did however have nice features when it worked."
A5FWAYHEJT6ZY,Customer Support?.........What's That?,"I have had my unit for 3 years and have had similar problems as noted on some of the other reviews, freezing, can't read data, etc......finally had enough, could not find a service center closer than 100 miles so I sent it to the company in Scottsdale AZ for repair.....they did not even open box and read my letter, just resent it to me unopened!!! What a bunch of Jerks! Maybe they will ""get it"" after I e-mail a photo to them of me smashing it up with a sledge hammer in my back yard!!"
AQ1B87TGLA8BE,"Nice sound, cheaply made","While for the money these are an ok set of earphones, they begin to simply fall apart after a few months of even gentle use. The earphone foam covering simply deteriorates and starts falling off and the inside headband support broke off on one side."
A3BI5T16S8HAUO,super !!!,small enough to fit anywhere.very easy to use and great binoculars.packaging was well protected.recomended as a purchase
A1U22I8CH2XQEW,This is the wrong part!!!!!,ADAPTER IS NOT COMPATIABLE WITH THE GARMIN c330!!Do not buy this part for the Garmin C330 it is NOT compatiable.  I place two calls and emailed customer service in early JULY 2007 to let them know that they recommended the wrong part.  I also referred them to other customer complaints.  Still a month later they have not corrected the problems and I am assuming they do not plan to correct the problem.
A3CKN5UDC9YZ5S,Sound Morpher,This thing is pretty damn good. I just bought one a few weeks ago and it rocks!! You could do a whole bunch of crazy stuff. It's a lot of fun and really worth buying if your looking for a little toy to play around with that new computer.
A33MVR4OT3321,Inexpensive and very useful,"I have had this unit about a year and it works great in the bedroom with a 22&#34; flat screen TV.  Very good function and can't beat the price!  You will need two people to set this up, but it goes easy with four hands and simple directions."
ARUK9RRF7Z30G,wonderful,This is a wonderful item love it  not able though yo put it down at all and have no complain with it other that volume
AJDQDH79SG5Y4,The closest thing to the best,"I owe 2 of these and just recently bought a etrex . The GPS 12 is still far better . I get a signal just about anywhere , easy to use . I've had these for years and would buy them again . There're worth every penny ."
A25WY3EFZOH6JW,Pretty good,this is a very good product. Easy to read and not that costly. My only complaint is that this ereader can't read manga or graphic novels.
A1PAGHECG401K1,"Fast, fast, fast","I got this charger set bundled with my Olympus Digital Camera last year. I had a Ni-MH charger set already (which I spent a lot on), and assumed that when I got this, I'd pull out the batteries and leave the charger in the box. But then one day I wanted to charge 2 new sets of batteries before leaving on a trip, and was astounded to see the Olympus charger was complete hours before.Now I only use the Olympus. It works with all my Ni-MH batteries, and charges them up quickly. It doesn't get hot while working, so I am not afraid to stick in the batteries and leave it be. A few hours later, the batteries are ready. It's so convenient.Compared to the other charger I bought, this one is nicely priced. However, I bought that a while back so I don't know what the prices are like now. However, I can vow for the quality of this, so far.If you are trapped by an AC cord, or using regular alkaline batteries and having to throw them out after one hour, this will set you free. I can't tell you how much having rechargable batteries changed my digital camera use."
A2J6752FBOYSKZ,Viper II a Great Card.,"Well, I buy this card six month ago and it works very well for the pourpose that i had purchased it.First of all i was looking for a card with great OPGL performance. The VII OPGL is very good.Sencond, I need that the card has a very good DVD quality, because i had a Pionner DVD-Rom and I didn`t want to put another card in my system. The VII DVD quality is very good too.And of course I need a card that offers me TV Out. The VII has it too, a S-VHS output and a Composite Video output.And the last point to choose this card was the games, it works fine in D3D (the OPGL is better!), and there are only a few games that doesn`t work, because the latest drivers (9.51.11 and 9.51.12)and the Bios upgrade has fixed a lot of bugs.Also, I had the card overcloked with S3Teak, It wokrs very well I suggest to put a cooler If you think to do overclocking.The technical support is very good, and there are Web Pages and forums about the VII that could help you too.It is a great card, It offer very good performance in all terrain!This card helps me to save a lot of money because it can make the job of other cards. (2D, 3D OPGL, D3D Games, DVD card decoder, TV out S-VHS and Composite Video (the tv-out works in everything, from DVD to Games to Windows Desktop application), and AGPX4 and 32MB.And think, what could you buy for that price!!!"
AYTRHPPIURUZJ,Horrible Sound.,I have a pair of these at work and they sound great. Ordered a pair for home and they sounded horrible. Returned them.
A1Z0O6RMQUP4LG,Good buy,"This is my first ""professional"" set of earphones.  I use it mostly to listen to recorded webcasts and lessons while avoiding distractions.  The pads are insulating enough to block out most of the unwanted noise (TV blaring in the other room, people chatting on the phone, etc.). The sound quality of these headphones is really good and clear.  After about two hours of listening, I feel that my ears are a tad bit warm, which I believe is the natural result of the insulation around them (and the lack of air flow/circulation).  The quality of the materials used, as well as the cord is quite good for the price. I do recommend this product."
A8TMTZFS8K4IB,Can't live without this radio!,"I have had this radio for almost two years and unfortunately it has recently started acting up (turns off by itself and won't turn back on until you take the batteries out for several hours).  It wasn't until I was without it for a few days that I realized how much I love this radio.  It makes getting ready in the morning so much more enjoyable because you can listen to your favorite radio stations or the morning TV shows.  I have also purchased other shower radios which were impossible to tune into a clear radio station.  This one is great because of its digital tuner and preset AM/FM/and TV station buttons.  I often take this radio out of the shower and use it to listen to TV shows while I am working outside.  When this radio eventually dies for good, I will not hestitate to replace it with another one by Sony."
A2W5KBV5PT4UPM,Great Product,"I have two systems that use this router so far.  One wireless laptop and one laptop with a direct connection.  Both seem to access the internet at the same time with no apparent slowdowns.Installation couldn't have been easier.  I was up and running with the first laptop in no time -- and the second (wireless) in under 15 minutes.  Linksys really does a great job of making this easy.The only trouble I have had is that in connecting to the cable modem, if I turn of the router and then the cable modem -- sometimes I have to reset them in order (modem then router)in order to make the connection to the internet."
APYKZUUZ6WV68,Can't rave enough about my Palm Vx,"Bought this as a treat to myself and that's exactly what its been.  Everything has been easy about it, including loading lots of software!  I love it!"
A3BFT94R5SI5PU,You'd have to be a REAL professional to want more,"Before purchase, I did some VERY extensive research, and I finally decided on the C-3040 over the Sony DSC-P5, mainly because of the ability to use other lenses, external flash capability and weight. The C-3040 is the perfect size and weight (too light, and it's hard to keep steady). It takes excellent photos, a little on the dark side for indoor shots, but nothing that can't be fixed with half-decent photo editing software. If you don't use the LCD all the time, the battery life is acceptable, but you should still make one of your first accessories a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger (THE first should probably be a nice camera bag). Unless you're taking a large number of uncompressed photos, you can probably wait a while for a larger memory card. The included 16MB card takes about 20 pictures at the default resolution. Downloading to a PC takes about 30 seconds for all 20 shots, and you're ready for more. Still, a 64, or at least 32MB card would have been awfully nice and should probably be near the top of your list.The flash, with adjustable brightness and delay time, the optical zoom capabilities (DON'T get a camera without optical zoom), the USB connection and the programability were the major deciding factors in my purchase decision.There is, however, one drawback, but I don't think it's serious enough to merit a lower rating, and that's the fact that the image you see through the viewfinder is smaller than what will actually be recorded. You will have to compensate for this when you shoot. The best thing is to take a good number of test shots to get used to this effect before doing any serious shooting. The manual says using the LCD to compose your shot gives more accuracy, which is true, but there is still a difference between what you see and what gets recorded.Overall, I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone, except maybe a serious hobbyist or a professional. Also, it might be a little pricey for beginners or digital first timers, but if you can swing it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.Final things: Experiment with the different modes (black &amp; white, sepia, etc.) and functions, and if you want an external flash attachment, you don't have to pay hundreds (almost as much as the camera) for the one Olympus sells; you can get the flash attachment BRACKET for about thirty bucks, and use almost any flash that has the 5-pin connector."
A1XQKXCETQKTUP,Don't bother looking for anything else but a Sony....,"To sum it up, the Sony E210 is incredible!  The colors are vivid, text is sharp and the flat screen is sensational.  The picture quality seems to get better each and every time I use my computer.  I had a Samsung 700NF before this but had to return it due to a defect.  I thought the Samsung was sharp but this Sony blows it away!  I did a lot of research before buying the Sony and originally was trying to find something comparable to the Sony without paying the premium price of a Sony.  Trust me, the extra cost of a Sony is well worth it!!  Follow the old saying, if the price seems too good to be true, then your probably going to get what you pay for.  Buy this baby, you will not regret it!"
ATNZ6ZION5HI1,five for the idea,"The 'Case Logic' wallet holds 'only' 264 cds, compared with 320, but that is a -lot- of cds. The loose-leaf design, stronger construction,(the handle especially), and greater ease of access make it the first choice. I cut down the booklets,etc, and was able to fit the the full 264 with all the extras, still with good access. To have all of my boxes metamorphized into one sleek package (not much larger that my full-size binoculars' case), makes me happy every time I look over at it."
A2W21RS38YK2G7,could not use for camera,"I couldn't use for my camera, Kodak C340.  It would not format.  I had to use a smaller GB. I had to switch my 2 GB picture frame disk and use that.  Should not be advertised for C340 camera."
A2DCZF2RN31FNK,Great low range handheld,"This is not a high end unit but it works great for camping and road trips with other cars in your group. I really like the weather channel. I only use the cigarette lighter for power because this thing will go through batteries like Obama through your tax dollars. Very quick delivery,"
A30CKVCKLG54OO,Great Camera But Cheap Making,"It should be a good smart digital camera.  It only deserves four stars because of Korean made stuff.  I lost it after I dropped and fell into pieces.  I bought this camera from Traveler Photo &amp; Electronics at  Taylor Street , San Francisco at a much highter price that your price.  I  suggest your price is reliable."
A3FZL7H94I6TW,My Expectations exceeded,"I bought the Bushnell Powerview as ""USED"", however it was delivered NEW and in the box. The value and utility of the binocular has in fact exceeded my own expectations in clarity and functionality.I Recommend the Bushnell Powerview as an excellent Entry Level Binoculars."
A2YYUJW9D5F72L,Best buy for the money!,"I purhcased this unit from Best Buy. I had a few problems installing the CDRW on Win98SE, but after a quick call to Archos tech support, they solved the problem. (I had the power plugged in to the audio out jack! DOH!). Since then I have burned 100's of CD's. I had read this was a poor choice for CDRW's but I really do not see what the problem is, unless others just had a hard time installing the drivers for it. All I know is I love mine. Thanks Archos."
AHGUXY5HWR0Z1,FAIR Camera,"This camera takes fair pictures.  Very good from a distance of 5-6 feet, not as clear as you are further from target.  The batteries also do not last as long, and the date imprint is faint, invisible on light backgrounds.  Spend a little more money on a better quality camera."
A3EWL465WRRJCW,Tiffen Circular Polarizer - This Rocks,"I went to my local camera shop looking for a filter that would give me the deep blue skies and the nice green landscapes.  The 58mm Tiffen was the recommendation but the costs was $70 and that was a bit more than I really wanted to spend.Of Course, Amazon was the logical next stop and I spent less than 1/2 as much for this lens and it turns out it was worth the price I would have paid at the camera shop.  I felt like a thief, but buying smart often seems like this, so I just enjoyed my purchase.The Camera shop was right, this is the best filter on the market, Tiffen Rocks."
A12NAEUGYXUIRD,Almost everything you'd want it to be!,"I loved this product right from the beginning, just from seeing how it combined the program listings from my cable and DirecTV providers into on guide, and would automatically switch between inputs depending on what channel I selected. Seems logical, but no one had ever done it  before!The 2020 is the way to go at the moment, because you'll find this  so addictive that any less storage space will not be enough. I find that  the Standard recording quality (which yields 20 hours of recording) works  fine for me at the moment with both my DSS and cable programming,  considering it's better than I was getting with VHS. I suppose that if you  get hooked on the better quality, it would probably be hard to go back.I  was disappointed that the 2020 does *not* come with Firewire ports as  advertised here on Amazon.com, as a box with future programming  improvements *and* expansion possibilities was really exciting. Once the  copy protection issues are worked out, I'd love to be able to add another  20 hours to the unit with an external drive, but maybe Replay will  facilitate that somehow.Anyhow, the bottom line is: This unit is in many  ways the home entertainment appliance I've been looking for for many years.  It's smart, it's convenient, and it can only get better as features are  improved and small bugs are removed. When was the last time you were able  to upgrade the firmware of your VCR?"
A2SRJS76JMNYSM,It's okay....,I mainly bought this watch for the altimitor and it doesn't work very well. It has different reading when I am in the same location different times. I still haven't used all the features year (still learning how) but so far it is just an okay watch.
A159CYF5EBYE1H,Buy the Sony CFW-338 instead.,"If you are looking for a dual cassette boombox, stay away from this one. The record dubbing quality is awful and the supposed &quot;Bass boost&quot; barely makes a difference in the tinny sound quality. FM reception is okay  if you are in a metro area, but it has a hard time picking up distant  signals. The RCA name has really been trashed since they sold their audio  and video business to Thomson Consumer Electronics."
A218KJ8NY8N8BA,Rip Off:,GG Ma is not 79 years any longer and sometimes doesn't get the fine print correct.The price was so out of line.  you should get 3 for that price.  I'll be more carefulwhat I get from Amazon in the future.
A1LG7243001X88,Not bad at all!,"I had always been told that Polaroid cameras gave lousy picture quality. Of course this advice came from my dad who had a Polaroid long before I was born. What a difference about 20 years makes! While this is a camera you  might not want to use under rugged conditions, it makes a great first  camera for the beginning photographer in your house.I am usually not a  fan of products that take styling cues from the iMac &amp; the VW New  Beetle, but the design is perfect for the market in which it is being  targeted at (teenage market).All in all, not a bad camera. Polaroid did  a good with this one."
A2CBEXNIS54DJE,Really good,"Was curious about the gray market, and the gray market worked great.  Best lens I have right now for 100 bucks"
A11TJ6XK5RD4FX,excellent,"this unit has a deep, rich, and solid tone and works well in recording music and it uses the cheaper standard csassette tape as opposed to the mini and micro tapes."
A3VHP36KIN8VOO,rewind noise,"Every time  you take your foot off the &#34;play&#34; pedal, there is a &#34;screeching&#34; noise as it auto rewinds a few words.... Gets very, very annoying after a while. Package arrived safely and on time."
A3DCBHD1TENYHA,pretty good,"I finally got a cord rewinder that works.  It keeps the cord nice and neat, and is easy to use the next time you need it."
A143ILPOSHCZ5W,good but bad,"This is no doubt a great deal for the money (I but mine used in December of 2003 on an auction site for $200 total), and like many have said here, it ""kicks butt.""  It sounded great for awhile, but it has a known flaw that can't be repaired.  I'm guessing that for all owners, the subwoofer will go out, and the part that will go bad cannot be replaced (the S64AMI power module). This part of the subwoofer is under a one year warranty.  Anyone doubting this flaw has not done their homework, and/or has yet to have their subwoofer burn up. I emailed JBL tech support with my story and that my future with JBL was in question. I got a pleasant reply that basically agreed with my assessment (that it was a faulty design and can't be repaired) and said if it was under warranty or within 6 months or so of warranty, I'd get a free replacement. The replacement is the JBL E250P, which looks like basically the same unit.  The respondent claimed that the updated design was more reliable and more repairable (none of these rare, expensive proprietary parts like the S64AMI).He also said that if it was not under warranty, I could buy this newer subwoofer for $211.77 ($188 + $23.77 shipping), which lists at over $400. After scouring ebay and the internet for equivalent deals, the best I could find was a similar Harmon Kardon (but only 150W vs. 250W for about $200 shipped...and HK owns JBL), or this replacement JBL for about $260 shipped. So, as a cheapskate, I actually opted to go back into the fire and try JBL again for the $212.  Considering I bought my PB12 used for $200 on audiogon.com and that with the new one, I'll have a fresh warranty, it still seemed like the best deal. If I'm made a fool (further), I'll let you all know.  Look for my review of the JBL E250P I will soon be receiving..."
AFGL6N0ASI92L,Tiffen 58mm UV Filter,I purchased this Tiffen UV filter because I recently bought a used Nikon 55mm-300mm lens and wanted to protect the glass. This UV filter is very high quality I am very happy thank you!
A3E79WZG7GIDAS,We like it,"I bought 2 of these for my van, and they surprisingly hold quite a bit, and do their job. We have them hanging around the head rests, so they aren't too appealing to the eye, but it's better than having trash everywhere. And, they are easy to empty. We are satisfied and consider it a good purchase."
A3JO155KF3379B,Great Sound ...but horrible  ear cups,"Bought mine in 09. Months later the ear cups are ""shedding their skin"" and they fall off very easily. This is not the Sony quality I am used to. It does sound great but man these cups are horrible.After all these months if I could return it I would"
A1XVWN79ELX0L1,"Great PDA, Terrible Software","I love the PV-400 itself. Unfortunately the 3rd party software (available only via download for some unknown reason) which is required to sync with MS Outlook is virtually unusable. I have tried it on both my laptop and desktop. It is extremely buggy requiring reboots, turning off auto-detect modes, and generally self-diagnosis due to lack of supporting documentation. Eventually after a couple successful syncs, the sync no longer worked period, and in spite of uninstalling, reinstalling, etc it will no longer sync.Since this is the main point of a PDA, it makes the quite excellent hardware quite useless..."
A33NHKMTXH3ED0,Surprisingly Light and Sturdy,"This tripod comfortable supports my 30D and my heaviest lens (Canon 70-200 f/4) yet folds small enough that I can actually fit it into my camera bag (I have a fairly large camera bag).  The only drawback is that it doesn't extend to as tall a height as many other tripods, but it is still very usable.  And the fact that it's so small when folded makes it more likely that I'll have it when I need it."
A1YMXGQQT7YWMN,Great compact little tool kit for computer or small appliance repair,"You never know when you will need a small screwdriver, and this little kit has several sizes and head types. Nice little zip case and tools held securely in."
A3G369YVTRYOAO,Great service and support,"I've about decided that various companies providing this type of equipment are about the same.  The only real exception was Intel -- and they've been backing out of this business.  I used to have the Intel AnyPoint Home Network which I liked very much -- but now it's gone.After LOTS of research and consternation at not really understanding how this wireless ""stuff"" worked -- I picked Hawking.WRONG!  Not only did I receive the wrong equipment (because they assume a level of knowledge I didn't have), I couldn't get any useful support.RIGHT!  I should have gone with SMC from the beginning.  I have three PCs in this house, happily sharing files, folders, drives, ISP access and a printer.  The monthly savings in fewer ISP accounts, etc. more than pay for the SMC router and adapters for each PC.Perhaps more important is the service I've received since purchasing all this.  I had installation questions (of course).  They answered them.  Then I ran into a hardware problem necessitating the return of the router I'd originally purchased.  SMC handled that smoothly and professionally, too.I'm up and running on the Wi-Fi network courtesy of SMC, their technicians and outstanding support.  I recommend them without qualification of any sort."
A26HC97V7QT5O5,nice,"I spent several days trying to decide if i should buy anexternal CDR/W or USB Zip for fast file sharing betweensevral desktops &amp; laptops.. Eventhough Zip disks are veryexpensive (ridiculously) as compared to CD-R and CDrws, zip drives are REALLY plug &amp; play.. we have Win2K- desktops at workand I didn't even need to install the drivers i just plug it in without rebooting!! wow..By the way I think 100 MB USB is more than enough for everyday purposes, except if you deal with lots o graphics..but then u better get something faster like a FIrewire or USB 2.0 swappable HD/ CDrw.."
A33AQU9PASHWOZ,Not Suitable For Music Recording,"First of all this records with a DC bias, which is not listed in the description. There is a noticeable difference between AC and DC bias recorders, with AC sounding much clearer.This recorder also cuts off all &#34;bass&#34; sounds completely, and turns up the treble. You'll be able to hear vocals very well but not the drums or bass guitar.I would say this recorder is ideal for voice recordings only.If you're looking for a cassette recorder to copy music from your computer, I would recommend the radio shack desktop cassette recorder, which records with an AC bias, and doesn't completely cut out the bass of songs. It is a bit more expensive though.Amazon was extremely helpful with my return of this item and I promptly got a full refund."
A3LULAHA20PPMA,"Fast service, excellent quality!",Exactly as described.  Fit our lens perfectly.  Shipped quickly.  Would highly recommend.  Much lower price than found at other sites or in stores.
A36CRQMWOJ0GN5,Handles get too hot!,"The handles got too hot, I could hardly touch them with my hands. For $25 I really expect more. If you care about this problem, don't buy this pot."
AYHFTSW6O5VY8,It works but only if you use it,"This is just a simple grounding device, a good idea in static electricity environments, such as heated homes. Since a &#34;static moment&#34; is unpredictable, it's a good idea to use the band."
AE6DDIKFMC2RY,This switch works...,What else do you need to know? You plug in your PCs and a cable to your router - and go. I used a Netgear hub for years. Replaced it with this Linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately.
A2AD2KZ77375UJ,This is one AWESOME camera!,"I received this camera as a birthday present and I have loved it since I first took it out of the box!  It combines the best of both worlds...a fun instant polaroid and a digital camera all in one!  I started taking pictures the second I took it out of the box and haven't stopped for the past three weeks.  The polaroids are fun and if you ever want a bigger picture all you have to do is scan it and print it out on photo paper...the quality of the instant prints is EXCELLENT!  The pictures are clear, sharp and full of vibrant color!The digital part of it has basic features, but still allows you to take great pictures that can be printed out on photo paper (and if they turn out a bit fuzzy any basic photo program will allow you to manipulate it and clear it up.)  This camera has come in handy quite a few times since I got it because if there's a picture you want to take really quickly, you don't have to waste time looking around for film.So far I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and I've used it every day for almost three weeks so far.  Contrary to what another reviewer said, the time that it takes for the digital pictures to download to the computer is just seconds!I would absolutely, DEFINITELY recommend this camera!  After seeing how awesome mine was, my boyfriend decided that he now wants one of his own!  The best part of all is that it's so light and can be carried anywhere!!"
A2U6DAQKR6B7OL,Ben,This is a great little item for saving music and additional guidepoints for use when traveling.  I purchased two!!
A1UPZM995ZAH90,Sometimes you just need a longer IEC cable,I needed a single cable to go a longer run and extension cables wouldn't cut it. This sucker works great.
A1M1R3X2B5XY4M,Expedition 3,"The Tamrac Expedition 3 is well constructed, but there are a few caveats.First, the camera backpack is really small. If you want only to take your camera and a lens, then this pack is ideal. If this is your principle camera bag, you will need to purchase MAS and SAS accessories to accommodate your gear.Second, the pack is water resistant. As such, there is a rain flap that covers the zippers. Unfortunately, this design can make opening and closing the pack a hassle.Third, the storage compartments will not allow for much in terms of accessories. Again, the design philosophy of Tamrac is centered on modular and strap accessories, which will often total more than the initial price of the camera bag.If you're willing to spend $36 dollars for the MAS medium side bags, $26 for two SAS filter pouches @ $13 per pouch, $13 for a water bottle holder, and $xx.xx for whatever other accessories you deem necessary, then you will have the principle camera bag you desire. Or, you can use this rather expensive, but well built, camera bag to carry your camera and very little else. Or, you can buy a bigger bag for less money."
A17TK38XH0TTTO,Good for the price,These have good sound quality in a quiet environment.  They work okay in a noisier environment (like on an airplane).
A3RCRAMYYW5J87,Very Unrealible,These are the worst CD-RW's I ever used.  If you have anything important use Sony CD-RW's.
A2N5YX7DLGPG3K,Good Stuff,Nice cord for practicing - a bit more solid than some less expensive models and I can tell it will last longer.
A3EZHN2I12T5XF,a little heavy,I purchased these to go and watch my 49ers beat the brake off of the Saints last year and they worked fine for that...however I'm a big guy over 250lbs  and I played football so I think I'm above average in strength and after wearing for a few hours I definitely knew I had something on my neck and a couple hours after that my neck was hurting so if you are smaller than I am then you probably don't want to carry these around your neck.
A2QT858YQPPZO4,Great product - decent customer support,"Background:  Experienced computer professional with over 20 years managing enterprise systems.I bought this router/firewall to replace a failing UGate firewall. The BEFSR81 worked out of the box and I've got a mix of Linux and Windows systems connected to it.  SNMP also works like a charm - I use mrtg to get the stats.  I have had no issues at all with Shiva VPN tunneling to my office.I started to have issues with the BEFSR81 locking up every day or two, and after exchanging a few e-mails with tech support, they agreed to cross-ship a replacement.  I plugged the new unit in, and it's been flawless ever since.  I couldn't ask for more.A bunch of people in our office also have Linksys units and are all satisfied.  I recommend Linksys to anyone who asks."
AMLAF7GB6YF0D,AWESOME FOR THE PRICE,CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS!! Its affordable and will protect your devices and it has A FLAT PLUG! So you can shove your furniture up against the wall without worrying if you cracked the outlet!!!!
API6D0PY13CAM,A Great Buy at this Price,"This is a great product for the money. I have heard that they are discontinuing this model, but with the interchangeability of all items with the Palm OS, I don't expect that this will create a problem in the foreseeable future.I bought this item and instantly became dependent on it. The first application that I found I use constantly was the address book. It stores my massive electronic Rolodex from my &quot;mothership&quot; computer. Then I discovered how cool it was to have an abbreviated NY Times and Wall St. Journal in my computer, among other things (free,courtesy of avantgo.com) when I was waiting for meetings or court to start. Then I discovered a free document reader at aportis.doc which converts any reference materials I can't find elsewhere to a sort of porta.pdf. Then I discovered a mobile version of my time and billing software.It really has elimiated many of the scraps of paper I used to constantly misplace. The little memo function is a great catchall. I don't miss the wireless feature (I get so much email I was afraid to spring for a Palm VII, which seems not quite ready for primetime) with frequent synching so that the avantgo content is always changing."
A1R8R7XKJJ3Q3T,Night Player,This was ordered but I didn't know I needed it. I bought a printer that has a Wi-Fi connection but for some unknown reason I also bought this cable even though I thought I wouldn't need it. The stars must have been in alignment as the printer was delivered and the set up instructions said put the disk in the drive after you have connected the printer to the computer with a printer CABLE. You only need to do this for the initial set up.Worked as advertised. Now I have a cable for the next printer. Company makes good products and have used them in the past and will continue in the future.
A1OWW6GE4BV4RX,"Great, if you put it in the right way","I got this for my son, who said it worked great in one car but not in the one he normally drives (even with the volume turned to maximum, music was soft and had a lot of hiss).  I changed the cord to the other end of the cassette, and then it worked great, the volume is now fine.  The only problem was my son felt rather silly for not having thought of switching the cord.  If anyone else with low volume problems hasn't tried switching the cord so the cassettee can be turned over, try it."
A15FOMWB1DYDC1,I ordered the wrong size,"Make sure you know the exact measurement of your lens before ordering a filter, they are not all exactly identical."
A1FABUN3XG1H3E,Dont do it,I got my com switch hoping to finally be able to use my fax without a bunch of messing around. Not the case. The switch does not work as advertised. I spent hours trying different configurations with no luck. My business partner has the same switch and his works fine. The company no longer exists to support it.  I don't know if my unit is defective or just a rip off. Dont waste your time and money like i did.  I am out the ~$250 I spent.
A1YS1218LBQVLT,Just as I thought,"I read the reviews of the MDR-V300 on Amazon.com and other sites and I got exactly what I thought it was.  I tend to read the reviews that give 1 or 2 stars to look for the negative aspects of the product and see if it's pretty consistent.  Don't get me wrong, the MDR-V300 is a good product and I love it.  Because of the other reviews, I didn't expect any more than I should have.The sound quality is excellent.  Typically, I listen to videos and music files on my laptop.  Even the cheap walkman type headphones sound better than my laptop's built-in speakers.  Although I'm not an audiophile, I don't think I could tell the difference from headphones that cost significantly higher.The construction is pretty cheap.  Other reviewers said that it's not rugged enough if you plan on travelling with them and take it in and out of bags or cases repeatedly.  It's true, but if you use them only at home or at the office, then it should be tough enough.  I only take it between home and the office, so they don't get much wear-and-tear anyway.  Actually, I like it because the phones are very lightweight.This is exactly what I paid for and I'm happy with the quality, construction, and price."
A14QDDTCGGFG35,Good Entry level,"If you are planning to start with a film SLR, this would be pretty good choice. Yes it does not have a lot bells n whistles, but it does have what you need to take good pictures; let's be honest if you are just starting out bells n whistles just muddy the waters. Once you get comfortable and maybe move up, then you have reliable secondary."
A14SZLBPDJZ9GJ,a must have for your lens,I learned a hard lesson not having this on my lenses to start with.take the time to get one you will not regret it
A35FTKYO9UQZWF,Great little device!,"I've owned an Ipad 2, an original Kindle Fire, and first generation 3g dual screen Nook. I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration."
ABOTQXNUBA1MM,"Brother's labels are simple, clean and used everywhere.","The dealer had the lowest price: 1/5th of the local office supply store! Love these labels and use it for LOTS more than just labeling files; there's a quote on my desk to remind me to breathe and focus. A tiny strip of plastic, changing a life in a tiny way.Have my baseballs in plexicases with a clear Brother label on each with name and info. This stuff is genius!"
A3JTMOTZ20ZCSW,"Lotsa of bells and whistles, but easy to use.","This is the first VHS camera I have owned since my old shoulder mounted RCA.  Having grown tired of looking like a TV news videographer, I jumped into this new and fortunately much smaller and lighter model.The main thing that attracted me to this camera was the very forthright review by Michael Lynch.  He is right on with his comments.  I just wanted to add, via this forum, that although the thing can do about anything a sophisticated user might want, you can just put a tape in, turn it on, hit the record button and take some excellent videos.  Also, I feel the 26x zoom is worth the extra cost over the 18x zoom of the Panasonic 650L.Oh, and one more thing..andyboy@mozcom.com...if you hated the camera that much...why didn't you just return it?"
A1UPQEP8TBOXDJ,Fantastic product - except for the wireless range,"This is, without a doubt, the most flexible and easy-to-configure networking product I've ever encountered. The web-based interface is a snap to use, and can be accessed from any platform that supports HTML browsing. This goes for both the routing capabilities (with an impressive array of options, from PPPoE to MAC address spoofing to a great little feature known as DMZ, which exposes one of the machines on your network to the outside world) and the wireless capabilities.However, the wireless range and signal strength is downright pathetic. Linksys should be embarassed that they let this product out the door. In our setup, the signal drops to %70 strength 10 feet away WITHIN THE SAME ROOM, and plunges to %50 if you range as far as the next room. Forget about trying to get a decent signal on another floor of your house.I intend to return this product to Amazon and buy Linksys' standalone router; I'm hooked on the ease of use of Linksys' products, but I'm going to have to turn to another vendor for my 802.11b needs."
A2YGTZN7BSCJ50,the better optical mouse at this price,"Well, i bought this free a few weeks ago with rebate.  What else can you say about a free optical mouse?  But just ignore the rebate, I own this optical mouse and another one: Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical.  They are comparable in price, but this logitech one is clearly the better choice.  More responsive, comfortable, accurate, better feel, better look, .......  Logitech products haven't disappointed me so far.  I guess no matter what Bill does, Microsoft can't stiffle competition here.  Microsoft is just not that great on hard ware.I gave only 4 stars because this mouse is not perfect, of course.  More $ can buy you a better mouse.  But this is a great value for the money (even without rebate)."
A2V0BI90SUSA3Z,Poor quality control or may just be Amazon packaging for shipment,"These are not Olympus' low-priced line.  Only the roof prism Magellan line is more expensive, so these are in the high-end porro prism line for Olympus.I really like the design of the binoculars.  They feel quite solid, come with quality lens caps, and have plastic eye caps that turn out into place instead of rubber eye caps.  I'm sure these will outlast any rubber eye caps.However, in the pair I received, the two sides are out of alignment.  What appears in the center of one the field of vision of one eye is well to the side of the field of vision of the other eye.  This shouldn't be and makes it very difficult to look through them for more than a minute at a time.  Also, it seemed to take a lot of effort to avoid having part of the field of vision obscured by the edges of the lens.This may not be a manufacturing defect.  I ordered two pairs of binoculars from Amazon (two different models), and the packing was woefully inadequate.  The only concern seemed to be that the smaller box not be able to slide around inside the carton.  The binocular boxes were in full contact with the cardboard box and therefore subject to the impact of any handling by UPS.  It's very possible that Olympus quality control did ensure that the sides were properly aligned at the time of manufacture, but that they assumed that, if shipped, the box containing the binoculars would be padded on all six sides inside the shipping carton.I'm also suspicious that I was shipped a set of binoculars which had already been returned by another customer.  While everything was there, the box looked like it had been previously opened.  It's possible this was just caused by rough treatment during shipping."
A1V91RVXXRVGNA,12+ Years and Still Going Strong; The Best Trackball I've Ever Owned,"I've been a trackball user for more than 25 years and this is the best I've ever used - and I've tried them all. Some of the Kensington and Logitech models are OK but I've had this one for over a decade, including some heavy gaming, and it still works well but I'm getting concerned about how much longer it will last. I wish I'd bought a dozen of them when they were still available new, just so that I'd never had to worry about not having one on my desk without having to search for an affordable replacement. If you like trackballs and you can find one of these in good condition for less than $100, grab it. Chances are you won't be disappointed. It does require regular cleaning but the ball pops right out without having to remove a retaining ring. I use a pipe cleaner once every few months to get all the crud out of the interior light channel. In more than a dozen years, I've only had to completely disassemble it once for a more thorough cleaning."
A4C3VTL1LGIMG,Should be in every kit.,"You know that you must have a polarizer, right? Such a simple yet powerful tool in the photographers arsenal. This one works great and is priced very reasonably."
A3TFWORJF1FCV2,SD-1700 Sound and Display,"Purchased July 2001 and was very happy with the performance for the first 12 months. Then disks started getting rejected with minimal, if any, damage to them. In the past 3 months, the display has gone (leaving only the OSD) and the sound is close to silent. Look at the other postings, see the same comments. I was a Toshiba fan until this purchase."
APFRIGDH0YPOK,IPAQ 3635 - Much more than an organizer,"I've owned the 3635 for a few months now, and I have to say that it's been much, much more than just an organizer for me.  It's been a portable gaming system, a MP3 player, a movie player, an electronic notebook, and more.  The organizer that comes with the  iPaq is great, though I am using a 3rd party software organizer which I purchased and downloaded online.If you couple the iPaq with a large CF card, you can put movies on them and watch your favorite Simpsons episode or even a DivX movie if you re-encode it to a smaller size.  I only wish that it was thinner, but the next generation of iPaqs should fix that.  Overall an excellent purchase!"
ASZAYZ2SE53WB,one cool gizmo,"This is the best gps for such a low price. Perfect for hiking, running, camping, boating and even a back-up car navigator. My only complaint is sometimes its hard to find a signal, otherwise i would have given it 5  stars. This thing is one cool gizmo that I highly reconmend"
A2OMO3NYWQQKS5,Cheaply made and will fail. Having serviced under warranty = $,"I would like these headphones if the workmanship weren't so shoddy. After two months of irregular use and careful handling, the insulation on the cord where it meets the plug has pulled away, leaving the fragile inner wires exposed. Swell. Having them serviced under warranty is going to cost about $20.00, w/ shipping and handling etc. Great.Koss. Where ""quality"" is word two. Word one is ""poor."""
A2NM4RYS7LM9RO,7-foot cable,The cable is very good quality and was delivered quickly. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend anyone looking for such a cable to not fear buying it from this site.
A1F8UC1G8YJ69A,Works well,"Just right for what I wanted: it plays my old music cassettes well, and it records my voice well (for making notes for a book I'm writing). No complaints."
ANDR87NHHVP9,BlackBerry USB cable,"The Blackberry USB cable is excellent quality and exactly what I needed for my 3G Curve, since I'm using it to tether my laptop to access the Internet and complete my email activity wherever I happen to be."
A3JJ222HEKM10R,Lens filter,What can I say about a lens filter other than I'm glad that I have one on all of my lenses all the time!
A1F5LBQSHGDZMX,Nice,Cleaned up my car CD player very quickly.  Does exactly what it was supposed to and I am very pleased!
AR64P9P1IOZA6,Great while it lasts,This was my first film camera for a photography course. It was a terrific experience using it and later on developing the film my self. The only problem that I saw with this camera was that the batter cover breaks for no reason. It's broken twice on me. I had to find a replacement part online since the local store that I bought it doesn't even carry the part.
A38KMY19YDYI03,This will keep the peace in your home.,I enjoy classics and inspirational music- and my house mates (granddaughter and her husband)  prefer modern noise - I can't call it music.  It has a long cord and enables me to walk around and  still listen to my choice of music and not disturb the peace. The low price makes it affordable for all - I use it with my Bose music system and the sound quality is excellent.
A29SHFBU5O9BWO,So Far So Good,"Hmm...this product fulfills its advertised function.  Holds memory quiet well, without umm, leaking it."
A1P98E8Z20JD1Q,Got no complaints,Just hooked it up and it works great. We've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won't miss anything! So far so good.
A1XEB1TSYPZVNS,JB920 all the way!!,"After using the MDS-JE520 by Sony, I was amazed by the sound. So, I bought this one for $599 to try it out and see if I could do anything with it. I like the sound of the optical recordings, but not so much the sound of the analog input. After one year of using this Sony MDS-JB920, I really LOVE the sound of this one, it is better..much better than the JE520.I think, considering the price, i can't get a better way to record my music....for my professional use I still use a DAT-recorder and I believe that DAT is still a whole lot better in sound, but at home I use the 920 a lot and this comes close to the DAT. For all those who still don't believe in the MD, try this player/recorder out and I promise you will love it! Thank you very much Sony!"
A1HFKCXWHHLUN9,"Excellent mouse, solid drivers","Logitech makes, in my opinion, the best mice with the most solid drivers. I've been using the Mouseman Wheel Optical for a few months now, and I'm purchasing another one for one of my new computers.I'm a little surprised at some of the negative comments I've read here. First, unlike what one reviewer mentioned, the blue light on the mouse does *not* get uncomfortably hot; in fact, I don't notice it all. Second, the drivers are much more solid than Microsoft drivers. Through many mice and years, I have never experienced a crash related to a Logitech driver, but I have experienced many related to Microsoft drivers. Finally, in terms of pointing accuracy, I use my Logitech Optical mouse for close work in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and pointer movement has been consistently smooth and accurate.I highly recommend this mouse."
A2K5FK58JSWXJ9,Great Deal!,"I am a college student living in a small room, but I wanted to fit my dvd player with some nice 5 speaker surround sound.  These speakers are really  nice, the best of the 3 being the center channel.  I already had some great  infinity front speakers so the rear speakers were a great addition (you  don't need to have the greatest speakers in the rear)  Overall this is a  great deal, came within a week, with an additional $10 for shipping and  handling."
A1UE0MH2AENUIF,Canon HTC-100 replacement for a great price,Plays 1080 full video to my TV with no issues at all. Fits my Canon Powershot ELPH100. The HTC-100 was expensive and its a great alternative. Excellent!
A926DHB054KNI,"Fair product, horrible support after it died","The router was simple to install.  It worked well for 3 months and then died.  It took 2 days to get tech support to tell me it was dead, then an additional 5 days to get an RMA number.  They then make you pay shipping back to them so they can replace it.  They claim to return ship it in 3 days but it is now over 4 WEEKS and I still do not have it back even after 5 phone calls."
AXB0JN0TGD1Y2,Wonder Winder,"The Wonder Winder is one of the best products I have purchased.  It is easy to load, wind, and unwind."
A3MXAF2K5ESX6F,Serves its purpose,Bought this for my friends mom to replace her old cable that was the victim of her daughters cat. I've heard no complaints so I imagine it's working like a charm.
A1848K8ZY9Q3F0,Horrible!,I received this item as a gift and ever since i started using it i have hated it. I truely think its a waste of money and i am returning it shortly. The original metal cover is plenty of protection and u actually have to take it off to use the leather case. If your looking for something like this buy something else this one is Horrible!
A1R6EPP6YFFZ5B,It works,"Stuff like this either work or don't.  And, so far, this cord has done it's its job and I have no complaints."
A3HVKHEAO0HTX2,GREAT High-speed flash!,"Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one."
A2AEZK0K9CFVE6,USB Adapter Power Kit,"Item arrived as described, however was not the correct adapter for our camera.  Trent at A Days Tech was very eager to help and did all that he could to solve my problem."
A3C4G3T0GDEBL4,Good in some cases,"I got this lens with my camera almost 2 years ago. However there is nothing much I like about it. The images it takes are not crystal clear and for some reason the rubber grip around the lens is falling apart unlike my other one. I want a good lens that takes sharp pictures, not this. I only use it if I see something interesting in the distance and I really want it. Either then that I barely use it."
A17JZD7062B1NL,"Great product, easy to use","I had chronic wrist pain and was barely able to use a computer for any length of time because of the mouse.  I switched to an Easy Cat and have had 90% reduction in pain.  There is so much less force required than a mouse, and you don't have to grip/hold it like you do a regular mouse.  I would highly recommend this or a similar product to anyone with repetitive stress injury issues.  I have used one on several different computers and only had software issues (which were resolved)on one computer.  That was my work computer, and they do so many strange things to them here that I wasn't surprised it doesn't work."
A1LF5S4M76QVMF,no sticks!,"i love this mouse, the price is a bit to high for my taste but since it didn't seem to be dropping anytime soon i went ahead and bought one. what a difference! the track ball mice seem so impractical after using this one. the shape of the intellimouse offers some comfort to your hand when you use it, and the best part is, there is no ball to get stuck when you are trying to make graphics! also the side clicks make browsing the internet less frustrating, i no longer have to use the back button in internet explorer when i want to return to the previous page.i gave this product 4stars because of the price, i would look into the logitech version before making my final decision as that one seems to be a lot cheaper."
A3OGUJDWF7IS6S,"Not loud enough, too big, but good price.","I wanted a basic memo voice recorder to give as a gift.  This was the cheapest one I could find that had a decent amount of features.  But, it somewhat shows how cheap it is...The size of this recorder (according to  the specs) appears to be about the same as other competing units, but it is  actually a little bigger than it should be.  If it was about an inch  shorter, it would fit better in your hand.  The recording quality is a  little scratchy, but my main complaint is that it doesn't play loud enough  to hear it without turning up the volume so much that its audio quality is  very scratchy.Another problem is it makes clicking sounds through the  speaker when buttons are pressed or options are changed.  I would only  recommend this recorder for very limited voice memo activities and when you  are looking for a cheaper device."
AX8JRUJZAFP45,Better than expected,"Yes indeed, this little camera has everything in it--more or less for some one who not just likes to play around but rather likes to use it for business as well as in a semi-professional way.One tiny problem, the smart-media memory card (I don't like smart media at all !) or the camera ? is not correctly working (had this problem with my previous M-4 as well), formatting the card when bought new is impossible! Toshiba will fix this problem I was told. During this time till I get it back I checked other Toshiba cameras, &lt;i.e the M81 - newest model ? and ... the same problem ! Is it Toshiba or the memory card? If Toshiba then what a shame, because Toshiba is a very good and reliable company in having put very good products on the market till now -- just hope that some one will wake-up in Toshiba and realize this problem ! I got my camera just recently, so I could return it but, why should I get another camera knowing that the M70 ... is actually what I was looking for all the time -- let Toshiba  fix the problem !!! (...) Don't be scared, only a minor problem I guess !? Have made some nice pictures with my M-4 (...) but hope to make even better pictures with my new M-70, especially with the unlimited movie option."
A8S1H645OTLYF,Used Poloroid Camera,"This camera arrived in great condition, despite the poor packaging and wrapping.It was packed in a soft cardboard box wrapped in Christmas paper, with no instructions, or original paperwork.  I did have small bubble wrap surrounding it that kept it intact.Shipping was slow, but the product is great."
A38027851EZ9GX,Proven Quality,"This review is coming from someone who purchased this for the following reasons:Casual Music listening, Gaming, and occasional use for movies at night.I went through the Corsair HS1, Audio Technica AD700, and Sennheisers HD555.While I thought the HS1 was decent the other 2 just lacked the bass I wanted.I wasn't looking for over the top bass either. While I understand why gamers likethe AD700, it just had no bass at all, and yes I do have an amp.My experience so far with this pair has been ""This is the one"". I love the ""neutral""sound to the V6. When I first started to use it, my ears did start to hurt butI think I've gotten use to it."
AJAFTON01BC3G,Perfect size,"I just got my new camera, a Canon Eos Rebel T4i and needed a bag. I didn't want a big bag and i know i will be getting a backpack later on . So my goal was to find an inexpensive small bag for everyday use.  This fits the bill.  It has two &#34;modular&#34; inserts that can be removed ( they attach with Velcro)  and the bag has the ability to be worn on the shoulder, carried in hand or ( which i totally missed when i got it ) worn around the waist..It's very well made, you can get this bag with confidence as long as you want something small ( it fits my camera with the zoom lens and the battery charger maybe a filter or two but not much else)."
A1IKCSS32AJGKS,"crystal clear voice reception,compact (small)","I have a set of these 2 way radios and they are excellant. My wife and I use these when we go to the mall,or when we go on a trip with another couple using 2 cars. My dad and I also use these on our 120 acre  farm.When driving in cars reception is good up to a mile.When using  outside around hills reception range seems to be around .7 to a  mile.When using outside in ideal conditions (flat land, a way from power  lines) reception seems to be around 1.8 to 2.2 miles.This unit is small  and fits in the palm of your hand. These units uses AA batteries which  lasts up to 30 hours."
AB5X63CW9O0R6,Tripp Lite LC2400 Line Conditioner 2400W AVR Surge 120V 20A 60Hz 6 Outlet 6-Feet Cord,"First let me say I did buy a new unit here but have used the 2400W and two 1200W units for over ten plus years. These units do work and do regulate voltage as they should and as most of us need them to do. Do they maintain a constant output of 120Vs ?  No, but in North America our normal PCs, TVs, Printers, VCRs, etc. are designed to function at a nominal Voltage between +/- 5 % of 120 Volts AC. In other words between a nominal 114-126 Volts input to them and they function fine. That's exactly what these Tripp Lite units insure, as long as the input voltage to the Tripp Lite is between 87-140V approx.  I live in a rural area and the power lines were old and I lost several VCRs over a period of 3-4 years. After studying the problem I decided to buy a 2400W model and after I started using it realized just how much power flucuation was happening and how often. I then purchased two 1200W units, one for my living room and one for my wifes' bedroom, moving the 2400W to my room where more electronic gear is located. Since that time I have not lost one piece of electronic gear. Where before it was a stretch to get 1 year out of a VCR (some expensive ones too). I remember one time I had a power loss that caused the computer monitor to go wavy for a second or two then steady. Normally all I hear is a click and if I check the units LEDS can tell if it's high or low power. I have somewhat better power lines and a new home transformer now but but there are still power changes the Tripp Lite levels out. In the event of a power outage I also have a 5000W portable generator I use. I have my electronic gear set up on these and can unplug one and plug into the extension cord from my generator outlets in my home. (Not a main panel dedicated system). I know what my wattage requirements are and can add a lamp with the new low voltage bulbs I use. Generally only use the generator a few hours to a day but did have an ice storm that required using it for 6 days. Some times I will have a high voltage shown on generator use and always have a low voltage use for a couple of seconds when my deep well pump surges on start up. Glad I have them during those times too. Do I like them yes, my old ones are white and were assembled in Mexico, while this new one is grey and assembled in china. If the new one last like my old ones I will be very pleased.  If you have something that requires a nominal operating voltage of +/- 1% 120V then this won't work, just dig deep in the wallet and buy something that will work for that. I'm a 69 year old guy and sometimes get long winded but hope this helps someone and you can read the complete specs for these at the Tripp Lite web site or at the bottom of the Amazon page."
A3T767O02CHFN1,"great for DJs, for whom they are intended.","Anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note: they were designed and advertised for DJ use specifically.  And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours."
A1MRBD4B85729L,Awesome,These headphones are very power hungry. They NEED an dedicated amp otherwise they sound like crap. Properly amped these headphones are awesome.
AN3ZPGKOVJ4HF,too long,"It's ironic that this came with a warning about the length of USB cables which basically meant to say ""Don't use this product"" It should be atleast a foot shorter to avoid exceeding the 10 foot maximum described in their warning tag, since all usb devices come with atleast a foot of cable built in (that this extension plugs into) but no matter, I've used it for over a month on a USB webcam with a 6 foot cable built into it which I plugged into this cord and haven't had any problems yet."
A3I1HTUVNI9INJ,A Beast with Little Quality Control,"First unit came via UPS in crushed package, 2nd suffered same fate. Decided to use anyway to get workstation running. Plastic casings do not line up, led lights do not fit their intended slots, does not sit flat/solid on a surface (ok on carpet I suppose). Decided to try and ""reseat"" leds but you get the feeling that nothing will every go back together or work properly again once taken apart. I can live with the loud hum as long as this thing works. I despise APC but wish I had gone that route. Oh yea, made in China."
A31UM38UFS5OF5,Just a littel static sound...,"This Product have a great design, good sound in my CD-Player and TV... but in my DVD Player I get some static, the same in the Home Theather, I think don't respond good in High Quality Frequence... the reception is good in  all the room, bad and good in the rest of the house... But whit this  price... I'm so Happy...."
A1AB2F8XOU928I,"Easy Setup, then Forget About It","Like the other reviewers, I have nothing but good things to say about this router.  I set it up in about 5 minutes and was up and running.A couple of highlights:- The MAC address spoofing is a great feature.  What this means is that you don't have to call your Cable/DSL provider to register a new MAC address (which they might hassle you about)- I've been connecting to my company LAN with VPN software and it works fine with this router.- The router has been running for months on end without a re-start.  I had a LinkSys router, but found myself having to reboot and restart the thing constantly.- For you gamers, Quake II &amp; III and Half-Life/Counter-Strike/Team Fortress run without a hitch.Hope this helps."
A3KEPCPANLSRRR,"MONSTER brand was not available, so I picked this.","MONSTER brand cables are king in terms of quality. In the world of cables, there are unshielded, shielded, and super-shielded cables to ensure a clean transmission of data, protecting against ""line noise"" and other outside electrical interference. - The only reason I bought this BELKIN F3U133-06 is because the 6ft MONSTER brand was not available. BELKIN is great at marketing, but when I opened the package I found a FLIMSY little cable that looked it should only be used as an emergency backup cable. It is obvious that the BELKIN brand is predicated on marketing and NOT QUALITY. - This product may work OK for now, but who knows for how long."

AKJD16NO3HE2S,Nothing but problems so far :(,"Just to let you know - I am not a professional and am just beginning to take my first, baby steps with filters. I read about polarizing filters and I became interested in trying one out. Not being sure about the results I'd get and most definitely not being able to afford an expensive one, I picked the Tiffen 58mm to experiment with. I purchased this filter for use with my Canon Vixia HF G10 video camera in the hopes that I could get some satisfactory sky / beach shots. (in this humid, hazy summer time weather, my outdoor shots are just meh)This is my first polarizing filter and my first day with it and so far, I am having nothing but problems with it.First, I suspect that I have received a used filter because the package was not sealed and the filter was dirty on both sides. (shipped and sold by Amazon.com)I cleaned it off and attached it to my UV filter that was already in place on my camera. This brings us to the second issue. It kept falling off. Luckily I was seated at the time and it fell into my lap rather than onto the concrete sidewalk. So then I got the bright idea (not!) of attaching it directly to my camera. This solved the problem of it staying in place (boy, did it ever!) and I thought that I could actually begin testing it out however, I could not adjust the outer ring with the camera hood in place. (In broad daylight, I *must* have the hood on my camera otherwise I get lens flares.)Trying to adjust it and then putting the hood on causes the filter ring to move.Lastly, I absolutely can not get it off of my camera. Yes, I am aware of which part of the filter that needs to be grasped and turned. Yes, I tried the rubber band and bottle opener grip and latex glove methods all without success. I have to go purchase the filter wrenches now and hope that works otherwise, I'll have to take my camera to a pro and see if they can get it off (I wonder how much they charge for that?)I wanted to do some ""with and without"" shots for comparison but was not able to do so.This filter seems to be more trouble than it's worth. I don't see myself ever attaching it directly to my camera again (that is, if I ever get it off!)Edit: I had to wait a few days for my order of filter wrenches to arrive (I couldn't find any shops locally that had them). Once they arrived and after a few attempts, I was finally able to remove the filter from my camera."
A385QDQ0R3S101,Solid Performance,My friends and I have used ~10 of these Teac drives when building systems for people and they are rock solid. It's worth the extra little money to buy a Teac instead of a lousy drive that comes OEM because this drive is  cheap and solid! You need a dependable floppy drive... this is it.

AK94AGPA2L5GY,Always Perfect - No Problems!,"Unlike the other reviewers, I have never had any problem at all burning  these CD-R's - and I have made over 60 of them. They make a perfect  recording for me all the time (I have an internal ATAPI drive by Philips),  with music and data, and the music CD's I make, play on every player we  have - boombox to Pioneer Elite, including the car! One reviewer complained  about how they look (huh??) - but I frankly don't see the problem. To me,  these are flawless CD-R disks. You can't go wrong."
A14CD37RHA69PE,Love This TV!!,"I have actually had this tv for several years now, but I had to look up how much it weighs for a tv stand and thought I'd add my two cents.  This has been the best little tv/vcr.  We have used it on trips, in our kitchen, and now it's found a home in our office. I have not had one minute's trouble with it, and it has a great picture. You cannot go wrong with this."
A37P5AXLZ24S9S,Great for general aviation with no bells and whistles.,"Purchased the Magellan 310 after reading an article on it by Peter Garrison in Flying Magazine.  If all you need is something that will point you the right way, keep you on track visually and in text, tells your speed and distance to go and expected arrival time, then this is all you need.  I punched in the Lat and Lon (easily obtained with almost all airport information) of the desired destination, took off and it worked great.  Had it sitting on the seat besides me in a Cessna 150 and it stayed locked without a problem.  No problems reading it in bright sunshine and the visual display is easy to read and follow.  Easy to enter data.Been flying since about 1979 and never owned a GPS.  Did use friends' Garmin 195 with the moving map display once in a while.  For most new and recreational pilots, I'd say this would have worked just as well.Only had it a little while but noticed that it stays locked on without any problems in cars and in my single story house.The ...color and moving map GPS are really nice but for basic easy and accurate navigation you can't go wrong with this ...unit.  Also it is a heck of a lot more portable, about half the size of a typical TV remote."
A3SMT15X2QVUR8,"Size does matter, and simplicity is priceless&#65533;","I love this!This tiny CD R/W is convenient and has that sexy look of slick new technological devices.  Included in the packaging was a zippered case that holds everything and fits easily into my notebook carrying case.  This unit is not a space thief, and it adds very little weight to my carrying bag.  That makes me happy.Unlike other reviewers, I found the minidrive worked beautifully on four different laptops.  The operating system for all of these laptops is Win98 2nd edition, and was preinstalled by the manufacturer.  Neither the two F580 Sony nor the two IBM X20 laptops contain hardware that has been upgraded from earlier systems.  This may be significant for the ease of this installation, and is certainly an aspect that should be addressed by the buyer and technician before purchase.The installation:I had it up and running in mere minutes on the Sony machines in both the PCMCIA and USB modes.  It took a little longer on the IBM laptops because these delightful two- pound models do not have floppy or CD drives.  My solution was to connect the X20s to my home network.  Then I installed the drivers across the net.Like the Sony laptops, the IBMs worked beautifully with the PCMCIA and USB ports -- I tested each.  I also tested this drive by successfully reading CD ROMs created with my Iomega USB CD RW and Bantam Backpack CD RW.  I also performed a reverse test by successfully reading CD ROMs created by the Archos in these drives, as well as my Sony laptop's DVD drive.The features that caught my attention were the size of the unit, the carrying case, the choice of PCMCIA or USB, and that it is bundled with all cards and connectors.  The special bonus is the Adaptec Easy CD Creator software that ships with the drive.The issue: it is sometimes difficult to get the drive to eject the CD.  It's a glitch, and may be frustrating to other users.USB Advice: if you purchase this, or any other brand of CD RW that uses the USB port, make sure you have no other USB devices connected when you are burning CDs. USB ports share the hardware interrupt signals, therefore you will not have a 100% success rate.  It is similar to driving when there is traffic when a 10 mile, 10 minute ride becomes a thirty-minute nightmare.I found this out the hard way with other drives; the Archos is no exception.  I use the PCMCIA connection with mine and recommend the same for all users who have other USB devices active.If you are looking for a truly portable, reliable CD RW this is an excellent choice.  I love mine and have carefully hidden it from anyone who might want to &quot;borrow&quot; it for their own travels.  I will loan the Iomega USB CD RW or Bantam Backpack CD RW -- but do not touch my Archos!Four stars and a wish that others had found the unit as easy as I have -- the lost star is due to the glitch.  I, however, am still very happy with mine.Victoria Tarrani"

A2S3OF1U66GV23,Good Card - Works with Pentiums and WIn 95,"I've had other cards (xircom, 3com) that are erratic and troublesome.  Sometimes requiring 3 or 4 reboots/power resets before they will start recognizing the network and passing data. The Linksys (running on a Pentium 266, Win95) just plain works without a hassle.All in all this is a good card, rock solid and reliable.I'd like to correct some misconceptions from previous reviewers.1) The card works fine with Win 95 OSR2 (but as noted in LINKSYS readme.txt CARDBUS is only supported by OSR2 or later).  If you are having problems I would suggest you download the latest drivers from the Linksys web site.  I don't understand why someone with a laptop without a 32 bit or Cardbus slot was complaining when he bought a 32 bit, CARDBUS PCMIA card and it won't work in a 16 bit slot (obviously a very old piece of equiptment).  Linksys makes a 16 bit card (the PCMPC100).  You have to be very careful with new technology and Microsoft OS's. (USB is another example it supposedly worked in W95OSR2 but good luck.)  I still have problems with it under W98SE especially on 2 year old hardware.2) My biggest problem was not the Linksys drivers rather it was the PCMIA drivers.  Check your Device Manager BEFORE (Control Panel -&gt; System - Device Manager) you try and and configure the linksys card. (I ended up deleting the PCMIA drivers and rebooting several times.) This was the most difficult part.  After this I followed LINKSYS instructions for installing the drivers and everything installed and worked.3) The card works fine on my 2 year old Pentium (NOT II or III) Laptop."

A24MDYO5UBUA5R,The BEST MODEM of its day,"Can't believe that upgrading my generic 56k modem to this showed a performance gain of up to 250%. Yes, 2.5x!! The generic modem, which most of have nowadays is pathetic. The connection speed is greater and the hardware chip set is phenomenal."
APSWLG7488OC7,"Product Works, but with Beta Firmware","I bought one of these and installed it in my in-laws' house, and it hung every 30 minutes or so, blocking Internet access to every computer on the network, including those directly connect via Ethernet. Then I installed the latest firmware (released 01-Jul-2003) and it has been working perfectly. But read the release notes with the latest firmware: &quot;This release is only for beta testing. This is not an official release. Linksys will not provide any technical support. Use this firmware at your own risk&quot;.I would avoid this product until Linksys releases non-Beta firmware (and the firmware works, based on user reviews), and then I would buy it only if you are adept at firmware upgrades. I'm surprised that Linksys (now owned by Cisco) would let a product out the door like this. Their tech support was no help on this issue."
A3B3QCDURXCHIT,Great Product,"First of all, This is NOT 4, it is 4 1/2.to answer everone else's problems, i just got this, and have been wearing this for two hours and find it so comftorbale, i need to put tthem back on. This headset has a sound card, so that lets you save processing power. No software is included or necesseary for intillation for Xp,2000 users. the cable is a bit on the long side, but to the people who find this distracting, i say, keep the metal wire holding the wrap on one of the 4 wraps! The sound quality is OK. thsi works well with Skype and MSN Messenger. there are more features, like the remote and such.also, one reviewr mentioned that there is somethig bugging him on the top, i find no problem at all.if you want to use headphones for an mp3 player look elsewherePROs:-Foldable-Easy on head and ears-Mic and Speakers are good-Included Sound card save PC Processing-USB 2.0 and 1.1 COmpatibleCons:-Lengthy CableAll in all this a great product, which i recommend for you"

A291CKVI2OH1T1,false advertisement,"The reason I selected this merchandise because of one of the images that shows the vivitar kit, and I thought the whole kit was included for that price. So if its not included that image that shows the entire kit needs to be removed, so other customers will not get burned. This is why it is false advertisement."
A3L52J6CJJSZYA,Networking has never been easier,"This unit has saved me so much time. I'm able to share my DSL service, files, printer, games etc.  It is really easy to set up and it supports PPPoE. I've tested the NAT feature and have not been able to break into my network.  Tech support was on the phone in less than 5 minutes.  They are located in CA and are open late to support us late night east coasters.  Highly recommend this product."
A3S42NPKAVC322,QUESTION,"How do you review pictures? Got as a gift and man I am in love. The simplicity is dreamy but since this gift came from a sale no instructions. I am very used to modern but I would love to learn the facets of such beauty, I know you can tell I love this camera.Thanks."
AD5GMDNVSIKAL,Terrible Sound Quality,"I bought these Koss earbuds because they looked like some other Koss earbuds that I had purchased several years ago that I liked a lot.  Unfortunately, while the old ones had good sound quality, these don't.  To call the sound ""Tinny"" is an understatement.  I thought about giving them away, but I couldn't think of anyone who would want to listen to such poor sound.  I threw them away."
AIW0JFVEF89B6,Mixed Bag,"I purchased mine in 1999 for its compact size and bang-for-the-buck. It is currently dying a slow death, as the sliding door mechanism has failed. The camera will shut-off if the door is bumped, forcing you to close and reopen. Also, indoor pix are washed-out by the flash. Don't know if that is unique to Olympus. Next time, I'll give Canon a chance."

This week I have spent over 3 hrs on phone with them and I am still not satisfied with the result.  I bought a nook color a month ago and loved it.  It went out on me and they sent me a refurbished one to replace it.  I told them I did not want a refurbished one.  They will tell you anything to get you off the phone.
A2NA3GSQ4VUG1Z,shower radio,"This product is great!  I got one as a gift and it lasted for over 7 years.  When looking for a replacement, I didn't see anything that had the same options that was as reasonably priced.  If you don't want to waste batteries on a CD player and only need the radio, it's a great choice.  I've used it even while gardening, or other rooms in the house beside the bathroom.  Batteries last several months, so it's cheap to use on a daily basis."
AI02Y5Q8Z5X8I,Rock solid!,Can not go wrong with a Linksys. Easy installation with a lot of setup options.Runs cool and this are stackable.

A689W8L78ZQR5,Not for people with a good ear and not to really enjoy music,"This player has very poor sound quality for audio and radio play.  CDs are Ok to listen to, mainly because CDs themselves have better sound quality. The stereo sound is very bad and CD programming is not very helpful too.  For people with good ear and sensitive to the external noises, it is not a  good item to buy.  However, for people who just  need to listen to some  quick news on the radio, it is OK to have it in the kitchen...."
A1FQOCN6SNXNG6,"Awesome, cheap, easy, simple",I mounted this t.v. in about 30 minutes.  The instructions were simple.  Came with its own little wrench to loosen and tighten the swivels.  I can say I am very pleased.  Money well spent.
A241JP6D9NIPS3,Franklin EBM-911 reader,The Franklin 911 was a gift.  What a mistake!  The promise on the box was that it would be compatable with Microsoft Reader soon.  That is why I was sold on this reader.  I kept checking with Franklin as to when Microsoft reader was going to be part of their system. Boy was I disappointed when they finally came out and said we've decided NOT to add Microsoft reader.  Well that was it for me and this product.  Without Microsoft's reader this product is almost worthless.  The book selection is small and not up to date.  So If I were someone looking at readers this one would be one to stay away from. My franklin reader is just gathering dust as I speak........
A14YR7QK3ASFFW,The perfect way to record.,"The mini disk format is the best way to record. The ability to organize the disk the way you want after you finish recording is a big plus. Also, you can erase the disk at a later date if you decide you don't want what is  on it. There is a protection device on the disk so that you don't  accidently erase the disk. Last, but not least, is the quality sound the  mini disk format gives you. Cassettes will sound so inferior once you start  using the mini disk player. Sony is the best one out there. I have read a  number of specs concerning the other brands, and this one rates very high.  Keep a look out for this one and you will be very satisfied once you  purchase it."
A290J8Q5FE22II,Camera for camp,Sent a few of these cameras to a camp which is on a lake. My daughter loved using them and we were happy to keep her digital camera safe from loss or destruction. The pictures turned out well. Grainier than digital but that is the reality of film cameras. The price on Amazon was very competitive in the online market and much cheaper than in the store.

A5A4U7VQFTDWA,Total JUNK!!!!!!!,This thing is a cheap plastic piece of  junk. The winder wheel inside has a rubber cover that is supposed to grab the cord and allow it to be reeled in. It slips to one side or the other and needs to be re-aligned constantly. The gap in the input of the reel is too wide and allows the cord to push the rubber cover off to the side. TOTAL JUNK!!!
A3LRX20PSINI2M,Incredible,"The users that have reviewed these headphones before myself are not lying - these headphones really are great. I'm able to hear certain instruments and parts of songs that were never audible with regular speakers or headphones. Whenever I'm traveling, I always have my friends have a listen to let them see how great they sound. Especially the bass! I can turn it up to around 75% on my iPod (which is plenty loud with these headphones) and the bass is not fuzzy in the least. I have had these headphones since June 2008 and have been incredibly satisfied."

(2)When running on crank power the crank unwinds at an uneven speed giving a short static ""Zap !"" at a point in each revolution of the crank .(3)External antenna does not seem to have any effect on either AM or FM bands , but putting my hand over the part of the radio near the ferrite bar (interior antenna) improves reception remarkably.  Radio works best using an AC/DC 9V. adaptor. No good if the power goes off !"
A39GQN6BRUGHKM,Should be promoted in Europe,Great product. Good balance between &quot;must have&quot; and &quot;nice to have&quot; functionality. Surprised at the memory capacity with &quot;only&quot; 2 Mb. I saw some advertising in Financial Times recently  but other than that little promotion in Europe. After two weeks already  seriously considering to leave the laptop at home and buy optional model  instead.
A170EFO2P2A4FJ,Know what you want first,"I read the reviews by other people here and am wondering loudly whether they know what these batteries are for? they are Rechargeable batteries for high-drain devices that require higher mAh rating. NiMH batteries or NiCd batteries do not hold charge like an alkaline battery so if you have charged an NiMH battery and put it in say an alarm clock, the batteries will lose charge in less than a month. they are for immediate usages like digital cameras where you need high mAh batteries and that digital cameras drain batteries. its more like ""spend it immediately"" battery unlike the disposable batteries that discharge in a circuit but drain very slowly when not in a circuit. I use Energizer AA batteries for my digicam and they recharge the flash much faster than even the best disposable batteries. A best guide is to look whether the appliance for which you are buying this battery is listed on the package or is identical to those on the package. this 9V would be a great thing for a toy where the battery drains out fast and you cannot afford disposable ones everyday.Just a note: If the device is a direct draining one like a motor and not in a solid-state circuit, do not use a rechargeable battery since if they are completely drained, they cannot be recharged."
A90FL3LH4OYI1,Flush?,"So, I thought from the head on image shot and &#34;flush&#34; description that someone finally had the brilliant idea of not making these stick out so they would bend or break.  It's totally just your average &#34;outie&#34; plug."

A2QTR6IZU0PVOG,"Works well, relatively good make, compact and portable","I bought this after reading the reviews here, so thanks to all those who gave their reviews. It helped with my decision to buy this product. I like how compact this pair of binoculars is. It's light and easy for carrying around. It comes with a decent pouch. One downside is the string offered as a strap for the binoculars. Hanging the thin string over the neck scores very low in terms of comfort. The string also gets in the way at times when you want to quickly use the binocular to view something. Still, it's a good product at this price point. I was watching a parade with it and was pleased with the close-up view I could get out of it."

A22TY9XHJGS4JH,"Doesn't Last, Waste of Money","I never leave reviews, but I am so enraged by this product, I have to leave a review. I have gone through two of these headphones, in the last few months. I was drawn in by the cheap price and the purported heavy bass. However, the product doesn't last. One side, always goes dead, within a short while. I hate having to listen to audio just on one side.Edited to addBought another pair and this time the left side went dead within 3 Months. That is unacceptable. Don't care how cheap this are; the fact that they don't last at all, makes them a poor product/purchase."
A1O9SNAWYWXND4,Fine for the price.,"This is fixed 10x -- not a zoom. Didn't realize that when I bought... even so, it works fine for the price. Using this, in the suburbs, I was able to see (albeit faintly) the Andromeda galaxy and the orion nebula. I can't wait to try out somewhere in the countryside... these are useful but of course, now I am left wanting more."
ALEHBIRW2J3XZ,Cameleom XP,I have the &quot;Chameleom XP&quot; and it is a excelantlittle &quot;Camera&quot; that I know of.Plus I havethe Mr.Photo that came whith it.
A2FUB7JX0I6LND,Fingerprints,It's really unpleasant to find so much dust and fingerprints on a supposedly brand new rather expensive filter
A3FTMD12DZYTVO,SONY TRV900  WOW!,Having a background in commercial television I did not believe that production on that level is possible at this price level. You will be amazed at the quality. I recommend the memory stick for still pictures and  you will need the floppy adapter for the computer. Your stills will be  outstanding. Couple all this with fire wire capture and a good editing  program (Adobe 5.1c) and your finished product will be excellent. The money  to step up to this is well spent.
A2D9GMF2DUV4S0,"Great product, useful looks could improve","Although the product is great and the protection indicator gives you a sense of security, the looks could improve.  Easy to install, and easy to mount on walls in a vertical position."
A1QOJ5J7H23GSR,Perfect!,It has a great quality and it's better than I expected. P e r f e c t ! ! !
A3P1SLOE4GDZ4Y,This is my favorite piece of equipment,"The LC10 is completely, uterly, hopelessly, rediculously, awesome.  It has excellent screen quality, the built in speakers do the job but, I would recomend getting a pair of nice headphones and maybe a headphone jack splitter to use with it.  Extra batteries are a little expensive but they're worth it.  With my extra battery I can get 7 hours of play time out of my player.  The controls are intuitive, and easy to follow.  This is just a well designed, well though out piece of equipment that is a god send to have. It also looks great when hooked up to a large tv."
ALFN8NL6HWXC3,Excellent portable for the money,"I got one of these a couple of days ago.  Excellent reception across both bands, even in weak FM signal areas with the antenna down!The only drawback I could find with this radio is the AC cord compartment is too cramped - you have to play with the cord until you get it in just right.  This shouldn't be a problem if you just plan to use it exclusively with either A/C or batteries. But it is a tradeoff. A bigger compartment would result in a bigger cabinet."
A2GOWDUXFP5P18,Fun great pics (see posted pics above),"We went to French Polynesia - Tahiti & Bora Bora were our stops.  I posted pics above (shots from the Lagoonarium on Bora Bora).  We swam & snorkeled in the ocean there with tropical fish, manta rays & sharks.  Most of the pics turned out really well (& we're not great photographers).  We're so used to seeing it real time on the digital camera, but can't of course with these cameras, so we bought two and took lots of pics.  When you develop them, you can request a CD too."
A28DH5XWPV8B4J,Great product for the price,I got this HDMI cable for connecting my laptop to my HD TV and it works great. I was a bit skeptical at first given its price when compared to $50 and $80 HDMI cables in Best Buy and Radio Shack. But its awesome!!! The audio and the video quality is great. Will definitely recommend to friends
A3PBSOR9HFADDA,"panasonic, as always delivers","these frs radios work as they are described, rugged, excellent features ,not to mention they are the coolest looking radios out there. if you are going to purchase frs radios this year buy this model they wont last long at this price."
A28YEO2J0XTA41,nice but still to ... for most,"Ok as a proud owner of a DCR-pc100 I was amazed to see that pc110 had all the improements that I wished for on the pc100 model.  The buttons are well placed, the hand holding with the flip out lever extension is a plus, and the pop up flash is a nice touch.  But it still only has a 1 mega pixel still camera capability, which is not good enough for most camera buffs.  The video and sound quality are still excellent, auto focus appears to be the same, good but not perfect.As with the pc-100 if you have either a iMac (or mac with firewire) or a Sony pc you can edit the digital video without to many problems.  Likewise the Sony USB card reader is a must!  The serial reader will not work with a mac and is so slow to download on a pc.  Also get the 32 MB card over the 64 MB card, for some reason the 64 MB card seems to get slower as it fill up.If you get this camcorder you must realize that the conventional VHS tape copies will lose some of the high quality video image and some of the sound quality as well.  S-VHS seems to do a better job but few pwople have S-VHS units so sharing could be a problem.The best solution would be one of those nice DVD recorders that are just starting to appear onthe market.  Digital to digital media, what could be better?"
A2YJLMOOZCB6YH,An equalizer that does what it is supposed to.,Works as it was supposed to and had none of the problems that other reviewers claimed theirs did. An ok equalizer for the price when they are becoming more and more hard to find.  A step up from simple bass and treble controls.
AO38WSM7N0RHW,Don't buy it  for C340,"I bought it for my c340 but it does not work with it. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the description in depth.  I really thought it did say it is good for street pilots, though. There might not be anything wrong with the item but it needs a better technical description."
A2CU3LKEQQ4VT5,Great product but buy rechargable batteries!,"I use the eTrex Summit on my bicycle. I get my trip distance, net climbing, speed, average speed, time of day, sunset, etc from this unit. I also hook it up to my laptop and mapping software for road trips. Now my wife doesn't yell at me to ask directions! Of course, I'm a gadget junky and INVENTED reasons to buy it. If you're going to use it in the car, though, I'd suggest getting the combo cigarette lighter adapter &amp; data cable as the batteries wear down relatively quickly."
A3P18KE1S0P0Y0,Satisfied Customer,"I live in California, so I always look for California sellers first.I also work for the post office so I know how long it takes for mail to travel. Although I didn't get it the next day, I'm satisfied with the product. The film and batteries are highly appreciated. I will shop with Photo Finish again."
A2LPA0397MU6B5,Great Binos,These are amazing! I'm an avid hunter and outdoorsmen and these binos are up there with the best of em. I took them to the deer lease with me a few days after I bought them and they performed beautifully. The PermaFocus feature is crystal clear at essentially every yardage an outdoorsmen would require. And they were fantastic in the low light atmospheres of dusk and dawn. For the price I bought them for ($60) you can't really beat this deal.
A3GHZZM7CNK77I,Memorex CD Jewel Case inserts,I have a recording studio so I make a lot of CD's. Most of my artists gives me the information they want on the CD & Jewel Case Insert & I do the rest. I hope Memorex never stops making these inserts & Amazon never stop carrying them. I go through several thousand a year.
AFXP7Y8YHHTLQ,Perfect size for small servings,"Great size for steaming veggies/food for babies/toddlers or a side of veggies for 2 of us for dinner. When I wanted to steam a few servings of carrots or peas for my daughter, I didn't want to haul out the huge pasta pot. This small steamer is the perfect size. I'd say it fits a cup or two of veggies and steams quickly due to the small size. I can leave it right on the stove or it stores easily. Easy to clean as well."
A17NVV7NERP2VF,Amaze your friends!,This piece of gagetry is a technical wonder!  The picture is amazing given the small screen.  The headphone surround sound is awesome too.  The only problem I have had with this is with the button to open the case to insert the DVD.  It sticks a little and I have to use alot of pressure to finally get the thing open.  Other than that I love it and love showing it off to my friends.  Best investment in electronics I've everdone.  If its small screen size (which is perfect for me) bothers you than get the LV75 but it has all the same features.
A20TKJ9AX9M93J,"Great, simple router for the home","I like computers and use them all the time but I'm not networking savy.  I was very fearful of leaving me home PC directly connected to our cable modem (AT&amp;T @home) without a firewall.  I also needed to connect my work laptop to the Internet and share files with the home PC.  The Netgear was perfect for us.It took about 15 minutes to set up only because @home in our area uses &quot;static IP address&quot;.  If this applies to you, don't worry, AT&amp;T gave you this info on your original order.  Also, Netgear instructions show you how to retrieve it from your PC if you can't find the paperwork.  It sets up via Internet Explorer and the router prompts you to enter the information.  For DHCP users, its even easier as this is the default for the router.  It took longer to reboot my PC after changing its settings than setting up the router.It was a great buy.  After 1 month, we're very happy with it."
A1WDUST309HM48,As advertised,"There were more discs in the package than described; just what was needed.  More than described, just what I needed."
A2LGLJTMVZKAJU,IT DOES PLAY BURNED CDS,"i have had this player for a while now and i've loved it since day one.  when i first got it, i was disappointed to find out that it did not play burned cds...but i later found out that it does play burned Cds as long as they are CD-RW.  i was reading at a CDR faq and this is what they said..&quot;CD-RW discs have a different formulation, and may work even on players that can't handle CD-R media. If CD-R media doesn't work, try copying the disc to CD-RW instead&quot;  i tried it and it works.  i can even erase the CD-RW disc and burn the same disc again with different music..because of this, i enjoy my player even more- Abe"
A2BLA7WV1PHP9W,read it all before you buy.,I didn't know that it didn't have android or Google.  I have to buy all apps. Other than this my son enjoy it. Also theres no customer service.
A8TH161HDA2FL,Problem solving 101 :>),"Having purchased this mount for an application it wasn't really intended for, it's doing just what I needed.I was looking for a way to wall mount a fairly hefty Polk Audio Monitor 40 to use as a center channel speaker for my HT sound system. Polk recommends these speakers be mounted at least 2' off the wall to keep from muffling the rear facing bass port and this mount fits the bill to a T for a heck of a lot less expense than the typical center channel speaker stands sell for ... Bonus!BTW, these Polk Monitor 40s are essentially the same speaker as their purpose built center channel speakers for 1/2 the price as I got a pair of 'em for what Polk sells single center channel speakers, and .... got a 2nd one to use for the center channel for my BR system in the process. So long as you don't mind either standing them up as intended or that the Polk emblem ends up sideways when you lay 'em on their sides like I did, they make a great center channel speaker for a bargain price.This did require some inventive modifying with my die grinder and a cut off wheel to cut away most of the mounting pad intended for attaching to various monitors/Tvs, then a lil touch up painting after the cutting but what I ended up with was just what I needed. The cable management already in place works just as well for speaker wire as it would have for an HDMI or similar video cable too.Yeah, these are of Chinese manufacture, but I was unable to find a similar American made product, and let me assure you, I did try.  This is my second VideoSecu mount I've purchased as I have one for my 37&#34; Tv in the BR and both mounts are well made, came with ample mounting hardware for many different applications and are very sturdily built with a great overall &#34;fit and finish&#34;.Hey, VideoSecu, you guys have a great potential for an awesome wall mount center channel speaker mount in this product by simply modifying the mounting pad to easily use it for this purpose as I did, are ya listening? Oh yeah, and I'll gladly accept any R&D;/Marketing funds you'd like to send my way ;&#62;)"
A2PNYNDVBBKMQ5,Great headphones!,I was skeptical at first when reading all the positive reviews but after using them for a few days I was really impressed.  Great bass which I liked the most about it.  Great price which is definitely likeable also.
A1Z9P17UJQKRKI,Perfect for birders,"These are great binoculars, perfect for birders. Check out the full moon view as well. When viewed with these binoculars, moon completely occupies the field of view. That makes moon view most beautiful."
A3R9D7QIRR8BQA,Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens,"Well packaged and so far seems to work well with good results, no negatives noticed, no pun intended, it is a positive digital camera anyway."
A2JY97KZPRU5XD,Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router is a good product.,I was looking for a wired solution in order to share my DSL Modem between by laptop and desktop.  This product was definitely high on my list as far as price and and all previous ratings were good on this product as well.  My experience with this router has been definitely positive but the only thing preventing me from rating it higher would be the installation instruction.  After several frustating attempts with installation wizard and failing I had to go to the Linksys site for help.  To their credit I was able to find information that indicated that I had to change the default IP for the router but I did have to dig for it.  Once this was done the installation went forward without any more glitches.  Therefore the product is good but the installation CD and associated instructions...not so good.
AQRHOEH2Z5XDM,poor driver support in W2K,"The shipping driver for W2K does not support hardware acceleration.  NVidia has a beta driver, but it is really buggy, and Diamond/S3 has not announced any plans for their own driver.If you need hardware  acceleration in Windows 2000, this is not the card for you!"
A1ZRXGFB1GS0CW,Works okay!,We're happy with the VCR but it doesn't work like a new one. But it works better then the one we had so we're happy.
A1X4GX1LHN36P8,great lense,"My first interchangeable SLR Lens,Very smooth and capable of taking great photos,I just took it for my first safari at corbett National Park,I took stunning images of wildlife in dense and wild jungle with this canon beauty.Images are very sharp in daylight even at dawn and dusk(low light) even it producesexcellent pictures in indoor shooting.Value for money."
AH4B4LSZY2860,maxell vp-100,it didn't do what i bought it to do. i ran it several times through the vcr and the picture did not improve at all.
AQHI9SEB98TIJ,Great!,Great Binoculars. I use these at the horse tracks and they are absolutely perfect. The auto focus is great as well!
A22VNF8GION1EB,Does NOT Work with TiVO,"This is a good USB adapter, but it does NOT work with the TiVO series 2 DVRs (when hooking up a wireless network). The TiVOs require the WUSB11 v2.6 v2.8 or v3. The product that ships from Amazon is v4, and it does not work with the TiVOs (at least as of 15 Nov 2004). The incompatability with v4 is mentioned on TiVOs site, but its hard to find."
AV8JMKG3LOULC,UV Protection Filter a Must!,"Tiffen has always produced quality products.  Although the UV filter is a simple accessory, it is absolutely necessary to protect your lens.Tips:  Have the correct filter size ready for each lens you own.  Put the filter on the lens as soon as you get your lens.  It is much easier to clean the filter than to clean the surface of your coated lens.  Also, if the filter is scratched, replace it.  Easier to replace a scratched filter than to repair a scratched lens."
A2J54650LNKWW,Great space saver!,"I like keeping all my stuff in one place, but don't like CD folders, so these slim cases are great.  I accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack, the case didn't break, and the cd was fine.  All in all, a great product."
A308JX5FIXGWQO,great cable - flexable and well constructed,This was just what I was looking for.  They are truthfull in their evaluation of the products they sell including the package information.
APV4CA1BTAGQ3,don't let the price fool you - these sound great!,"got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since.  nothing beats these for performance vs. value.  I'm a picky listener (mostly classical) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced.  get some, you will be pleased."
A1XBSGBEM3O29R,Fast...Very Fast.,"I bought the modem so I could get my mail remotely.  This modem really does perform.  When browsing with the Opera Browser on my Revo, I swear sometimes it's faster than my PC.  I Highly reccommend it, even though the  price is a bit high.  Just use the AC adapter whenever possible, this thing  flies through batteries."
A1MNQINSSNHZDX,economical cables that do what they are supposed to do,these cables are just great.  I cant believe how economical they have become through out the years.  These are sturdy
A1PLH8QRV17A6E,Does the job,"Set up was easy, was able to get all my audio components hooked up in minutes. Very good deal, glad I got it."
A359C468REHQ6L,"Revolutionary product, But Shinei is a terrible company","The go-vox is distributed by Landware but produced by  Shinei, a Singapore based company.  I have Palm IIIc and  decided to shop on Shinei's on-line shop since they sell a  product specifically for the IIIC.  What a mistake.  I purchased the product on 19 Jan 01, my credit card charged on 5 Feb 01. I still have not recieved the product. I have sent many e-mails to Shinei requesting assistance but have only received one response in more than 2 months  stating that they may have problems shipping the product.  I have sent 3 e-mail addresses to contact me and 2 mailing addresses.I would definitely stay away from this product."
AWHM7I6Q5M7CR,A clear window to the world.,"This is a great little LCD monitor! It's bright, extremely clear, and seems quite roomy. I've used it with my Macs and PCs without any trouble at all. Mine did ship with a &quot;stuck green&quot; pixel in one corner, but it's hardly noticeable. Initial setup was a little more involved than I expected, requiring connecting several cables beneath a plastic panel in the back of the monitor. This monitor has both DVI and regular DB15 connectors. If you don't plan to use the DVI connection, you might want to go with a cheaper model. I use both connections, which allows me to have a Mac and PC connected to the monitor at the same time. Note that connecting the monitor to the newer PowerMacs via DVI usually requires a fairly inexpensive ADC to DVI connector cable. The digital display is just fantastic!"
A176P2BEE2LF22,well done,"people who think designed this...practical thinkers..i see a well thought out, well carried out product being sold at a reasonable price.however, the manufacturers description has one flaw...this does NOT have phone line protection...everything else is as described.yes i recommend and i would again buy, and just might for other areas of the house and shop."
A2BJUIIQNFRLF9,Panasonic Headphones,Very good headphones for the price. Use them all of the time and believe we have already got our money's worth.
A2Y870S7P44V4C,Nice little gadget,"I received this product a day ago and am happy with it.  It's simple and reliably does what it's supposed to do.  I bought it primarily for 'bulb' exposures [with my D-Rebel], but, of course, it is also useful when you want to avoid camera shake or to get yourself into the shot.As others have noted, it is extremely light (15g) and tiny.  Those reasons are why I picked this remote over the RC-5 and RS-60E3.  Also, there is a camera strap clip included, so it will be quickly available.  Canon is even kind enough to include batteries.  This is definitely the one to buy."
A1MX2IU9XLA7ZQ,Really great device,"I purchased one of these about a week ago. I must say, I am very happy with it! The sound quality is tremendous, it has a great form-factor, and the manufacturer is very intelligent! I was having a few problems (the pause button wasn't working very well and there was a lot of background noise when the devise wasn't playing anything); but after a simple firmware update, these troubles (and more) were solved! There are, however, 3 problems (the reason why I didn't rate this 5 stars):1) Like many others have said, the headphones are really, really bad. However, this wasn't a problem for me, because I already had better headphones that I was planning on using.2) Again, like others have said, the case is really, really bad. Not only is the device mostly useless, but also the leather exterior and the vinyl interior are attached by very weak glue. By the time I realized this, it was too late - now some of my buttons are sticky. They really could have put more work into this aspect.3) The 64MB of onboard RAM isn't very much. It is certainly better than the other Nomad II (which has no onboard RAM), but it could be more. I have had to purchase an extra 128MB SmartMedia card, which has solved this problem.So, as you can see, none of these problems are monumentally bad, and all can be resolved. In reality, nothing listed above could merit not purchasing this MP3 player. Its size, functionality, and programming are well worth the [$], plus roughly [$] for the 128MB card.P.S. On the subject of the NiMH battery (as mentioned previously), the device is programmed to detect how much of the battery has been charged when it is set into the cradle. Somehow Creative has found a way for a NiMH battery to act as a LiIon one. This definitely isn't a problem."
A21OC6280B3X23,Works like a Champ!,"I looked around and really couldn't find a better product at a better price. There was no assembly required (there is if you get the vcr tray with it, however). Actually, I had to install ONE screw. It has a small turning radius, so I didn't have to move my dresser out from the wall and I can even keep my things on the dresser. This turntable barely takes more space than my tv alone did. I have no complaints about the quality of the product. I am totally satisfied with my purchase."
A12D1J9EBD6WGV,Handy Device that works,"Device works and is very helpful if you need a volume control for headphones.  We used it for an extension off a TV.  Works as advertised.  I would have given a 5 star but the volume control is a bit touchy.  But for the price, it's worth it."
A2KTRW29OIUZUM,I had no instructions; could not make heads or tails of the device so I sent it back.,"I should have known better than to order this type of device as it had no instructions and I know nothing about MP3 devices.  I ordered it simply by brand name, but I could not get it to work and I sent it back."
A2QG6GHFWA51OY,Love the extension cable,"I didn't know that you could purchase USB extension cables - always wished you could, but never researched it.  A friend sent me this link and now that I know what's available, I'll be back!"
A1F4WDDXVULVB1,Awesome!!!,"I have had my pc pro cam for almost 3 yrs now. It has fallen off my pc many times and still is working like a charm!!! It has a great picture quality and everyone compliments on how clear the picture is. I truly believe that this is best cam that I have come across in the web cam world, and everyone else who views my cam says the same also. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking of buying a cam."
A2G9A0W9OMOU6X,Short wave Antenna,great purchase for the price and delivery time. Product is very well constructed and would recomend this to any one for use with as a external antena
A3CUJY7GTQV2B9,Does what it said it would,"Plug it in and project your presentation to the world. Works well, no stress. Great product! Works well for visuals."
AJAUG0J93BPLA,Room for Everything,"Very roomy, has compartment for all photography needs. Just the right amount of cushioning. Great bag. One of the best selling points for my husband is that is can be used as your second carry-on on an airline. It is designed to fit under the seat. We planning a trip that's a photographers dream. This way he can keep all his important equipment with him."
A1Y8JXNKPT0GM3,The Visor Is a Great Buy compared to Palm or Compaq,"Visor is great. Made by the former mastermind behind Palm seeking to make a better PDA, same to better technology for less moola. The expansion module allows you to play MP3's, use wireless internet and e-mail, play video games, and best of all, once the 2MB are squandered, you can buy an 8MB expansion. With the USB cradle, files can be loaded onto your visor. You can also beam applications and files to other PDA's. Like all PDA's, the batteries only last for about 2 weeks, but changing them is a breeze (remembering to replace the batteries withen 1 minute of taking them out). The Visor is inexpensive and from my experience with other PDA's, a much better buy than the Palm IIIxe or the Compaq IPAQ"
A2GT8XSGBNA0NP,Excelent performance,Excelent performance and quality for the low cost. Fast autofocus and very good sharpness and definition. Very low weight. Thanks
A1AOSJIKQ6YTL7,I love my panasonic vcr!,"I bought the model before: the PV-8450 two years ago after some research in consumer reports. The 8450 has super reliability (no problems) and  picture and sound quality comparable to the top vcr brands (sony,  mitsubitshi, and toshiba.) I also really like the fact that this vcr can  record in LP mode. Tapes in LP mode hold 4 hours and play better in my  panasonic than other vcrs. I was so impressed, i also went out and got the  PV-945H. This one is just as good if not better and has some added  custimize onscreen labels for programs. Super vcrs! The only problem is the  odd shape of the remote."
A273BZSB4W227N,Problem with 3835 model,I have ordered this item how come it doesnt fit with my ipaq 3835. wat will i do. Tnx
A29DI3DIZM96UM,Great space saver,I love the both of these cases great space savers. The quality seems great enough not to scratch disks.Sometimes zippers are a pain)
A1554TO87E8YI7,Its Basic It works I like it,"I havn't had a problem with it its worked on gta3, all emulators,roms,spiderman,and its good flawless. I have had it for about a year. I  paid like 10 bucks for it , it still goes strong."
A2FBQD2FG0ENFI,Great Palm!,"Having used a Palm IIIx, and a HP545 for a total of over 2 years, I decided to change to the Prism. I have found this product to be very well made, and excellent in almost every regard. The screen is so much better than the m505. But obviously not as good as the PocketPC active screens (even passive ones). But then again, is a Palm a toy for looking at pictures and playing games, or is it a functional device, to keep your life in order as well as able to have some photos and games. On that note, I do play games and have photos on my Prism, and I can say that the 16-bit screen makes it all the more worthwhile. And when one holds the Prism about 30 cm away, the pixels are not objectionable. Anyway. My main issues with the Prism are threefold: Firstly, only 8 Mb of RAM. They should either upgrade it to 16 Mb (better yet 32 Mb) and have some Flash ROM. Surely it is not that expensive. Secondly, the unit is a bit on the heavy side. It is okay for me, but it seems to quite heavy, compared to a Palm III or m10x. But it feels lighter than a PocketPC (but not much so). And lastly, the very nice finish on the case fades quickly. I have had mine for just under 3 months and already the cobalt blue has worn off around the back bottom area. No so good. Nevertheless, it is an excellent device that is probably one of the most practical PDA on the market."
A1QWGPBP61DPQP,Great for a K10d (also works for K5),"One thing you can't easily find in reading through Pentax's documentation is that this little remote will work as a trigger for your camera just as the Remote F will.  That, and it will cost you a lot less.I can't say it is better or worse than the Remote F, but it has all the same functions.  The only flaw maybe for those who use the added grip; this remote won't fit into the spot provided for a remote.  Never-the-less, I don't find it a big deal as I am sure most won't, unless you really use the thing a lot.This items is a great deal, altough as others have noted, be aware of the shipping fees.**** UPDATE ****I recently purchased a Pentax K5 and want to report that this remote will for it as well.  I'm not sure that it is any better than other Pentax controllers, but if the price is right for you, it will serve you well.It still has a nice shape and form and slides nicely into a small camera bag pocket.  I'm not sure the K5 grip has a space for a controller (even the Remote F), but the ability to slide a remote into the grip is a minor convenience that can be compensated for with camera straps or your camera bag."
ADEQE8AHLM7QD,I love this drive,I have it for a year and have even knocked it off my desk once!  It damaged that disk but otherwise no harm done.  I have purchased four of them (always the USB model) and I have nothing but priase for these drives!
A23AF9X5323ME3,Get what you pay for,"The unit arrived in minimum time, had to drill out existing pivot bolts and install larger size to take out the sag or play, it works great, also I had to cut an area out from the bottom of the plate to have access to the hook ups.As I said you get what you pay for the unit was suppose to fit my vizio 26 inch tv."
A1CSE0CUYT5ECF,finally,finally I can use this camera without costing a fortune in batteries. I couldnt find a dock to charge directly and aa rechargables would die before i put them in.  this battery and charger are the answer
A1JNLPWJ1ZFJ6X,Excellent unit,"I've had this player for 2 years so far, with no regrets at all. It's been reliable, has a long battery life and it's fairly sturdy too.(as MDs go) It even survived a 7 foot drop from the top of my locker. The sound quality is excellent, helped by the powerful amp and headphones. Most MD players are notorious for being packed with tinny headphones.  In fact, of all the MDs I've listened to, this is the only one I wouldn't buy a new set for. This MD player is one of the cheapest portable recorders around too.I do have a few minor niggles though:First off, the RCA jack the player comes with is limited in its usefulness.I would suggest buying a male/male cord. (which will set you back a whopping $3)Second, the unit is a little bit bulkier than the latest batch of MDs. It still slips easily into a pocket.Third, the player can skip it jostled enough. No MD is truly skip proof though, so if you intend to jog, I'd suggest a MP3 player. I've never made it skip while doing anything other than jogging.Overall, an excellent unit. Definately worth considering.  Even with all the new players out there, I'd still go with this one."

A3RNVPGOTRRV4H,Nonfuntional with Win2K &amp; XP,"I purchased this drive and had good success getting it to work with Win98 on an IBM Thinkpad.  I decided to upgrade the notebook's OS to Win2K Pro for work and security issues and that was when my problems began.The drivers HP supplied did not work properly and the computer continually claimed that the drive was a 8290.  Once I upgraded the OS, no matter what drivers I used, the drive was not recognizable by the PC and the two times I managed to get the software (Roxio EZCD) to recognize the drive, I ended up with coasters.Attempts to get a resolution from HP on this were futile.  The drivers did &quot;bad things&quot; to my notebook requiring a reinstall of the OS.  The best I have been able to determine (from reading other people's problems with the same drive), it appears that there are issues with the firmware of the CDR and if you get the earlier versions of this drive you may be able to get it to work.  The older versions of the firmware (which my drive falls under) do not work as advertised.I just checked (today is 04/10/2002) HP's site for updated drivers and they still have the old drivers which caused the problems (problems were encountered 11/02/2001, drivers used are dated 10/31/2001).I gave the drive to a friend of mine who uses Win98.  She is able to use it without issue on her computer (so far).  As long as you are running it with one of the older OSes, you may be o.k.  Using anything newer and you are definitely on your own.Joe."
A1VLWL1SCYPEU2,junk,The 1st time I used it it got stuck on the lens and was impossible to get it off.  I ended up dropping the camera and breaking the bottom plate of the camera.  This was the most expensive filter I ever bought.
APUK9GI33ZJUE,Perfect Shower Radio,"The Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio is everything its advertised to be and more.  Worked perfectly after batteries installed, was/is easy to preprogram stations -even an AARP senior can do it, the sound is great with plenty of volume range. Portable so use it in main bath, the shower, and outside.  Wonderful reception capability. Highly recommend it!"
A633NIAR4JJAR,The best sounding headphones under $50,"I've had these wonderful phones for three months. I use them for my ipod classic. The sound is rich and full. Strong bass with no distortion, even at high levels. Listening to Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" makes the song sound like a dream. You can hear Stevie make sighs and sounds you don't hear on the cheap ipod earbuds.And when you listen to Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick,"" it feels like you're sitting right next to John Bonham as he pounds on the drums.It's unbelievable how good these phones are. When you listen to the Counting Crows' acoustic version of ""Amiee,"" with its mandolin intro playing in the left ear, and rich acoustic guitar coming through on the right ear, you will have an eargasm, baby! It is an experience!The Portapros are also, hands down, THE most comfortable headset I've ever worn. You can adjust them to fit tighter or more loosely around the ears, and the extra padding really helps with the comfort.I should say that these are not noise cancelling or sound isolating. I can't wear them in bed at night because even with the volume 1/3rd up on the ipod, my wife can hear them. Same thing with riding the train or bus. You won't want to wear them in public, partly because they look like something worn on the set of the 1984 flick Tron, and partly because your neighbors won't want to listen to your music.But if you care about excellent quality sound, and you are not disturbing anyone, these are THE best sounding headphones you can buy under $50. They are a BIG step up from the so-so ipod earbuds and a bigger step up from anything Walmart sells.I should say that these sound better on MP3 players than they do on Hi-Fi equipment. I definitely prefer my beloved Grado SR125s for listening with my stereo or with my laptop.But the Portapros are a steal at $38.I almost forgot to mention that there is a lifetime warranty on the Portapros. If they accidently break, and you still have your receipt, Koss replaces them for free. Awesome!"
A1Y25XSOZPUVCB,Tired of telemarketers!,It's super easy to use; all you have to do is when you don't recognize an incoming phone number is push the button and walk away.  The prerecorded message takes care of the rest!Zenith ZEP100 EZ Hang-Up
AWI5BI3OU2LBO,Very pleased with the large case,Thank you for shipping this item so promptly. I think it's an awesome case that holds all my CDs plus more...It looks well made and I will be using it every day! Nice item. Thank you very much.
A2HWX58TX5R25D,TapeRecorder,The recorder works fine and the price is right.  The only problem was the delivery time--  seemed we waited extra long.
A3QUK8180C0B1G,THIS IS THE MOST TERRIBLE DEVICE,"Before I bought to my Nook 3g-wifi , I couldnt decide between nook or kindle. Even though the some of the reviews say that 'nook gives problem'  , i didnt care and i wanted to give it a chance because of its colorful and touch screen and I bought Nook 3g-wifi instead of Kindle. I wish I wouldnt buy it . This device drove me crazy.  First, I turned on the device and it was little slow not really frozen, I didnt care and then after a while, It started to give more problems. Anytime when I turned the pages it goes really slow, sometimes doesnt even change the pages. After a short time using it , it started to shut down and restart itself. it is so crazy. I tried to use 3G, I have an Android smart phone and I always use 3G without any problem around my neighborhood, but this defected device (nook) didnt connect 3g, and I hardly connect the internet by wifi, I called customer service and I tried to explain the situations, they just told me some stories, please be patient ...be patient. sorry... sorry... When I bought the device , they were not really patient to charge money,  just sell it then nothing.Finally I returned it. Now I am planing to buy kindle but I feel so nervous, I dont want to have same problems again.NOOK looks so nice and stylish, color screen and e-ink screen together, it provides some of android apps , it seems a functional device, but absolutely not.  I have a 2nd generation ipod touch, I have been using it for 2.5 years,  at least 3 times I dropped it to the concrete, I havent had any problem. It is totally worth to my each penny.Anyway, I had a bad NOOK experience , and I just wanted to share it.I hope nobody gets the same situation."
AKUCE9JFXU8GA,Works well,"Had this case for a few months now. Holds CDs well, the velcro straps stay nice and tight on the visor. No issues so far. I like the extra little pocket for holding tickets, etc."
AUQQWQ5GTVKTQ,It's too bad they stopped making this,"This is an awesome DVD player. I bought it after doing a lot of research online and truly understanding how the machine works. It came down to this one.Why?Zoom function: You can actually zoom in and look at minute detail on the movie and pan left and right on it. It also allows for ""outside"" angles -- meaning you can pan left or right while a movie is playing to see outside details from the center screen, if the director/dvd makers allow it (which I'm sure will be the next push in the technology). Speeds: The selection of scan through speeds is amazing -- all with startling clarity. Resolution: I scoffed that a DVD could produce THAT much better resolution and clarity of sound, but whoa man! This is amazing -- I truly am blown away with what kind of quality you get off this DVD player. Compatibility/ease of function: This DVD player is so incredibly easy to use, you basically just plug it in and play a movie.Finally: The dual tray for DVD play. This player comes with two trays to put in two movies -- which you'll find with longer epics out there. It's simple to switch between on disc to the other, and it makes it awfully convenient for viewing pleasure.They should really bring this product back. It's the best out there."
A202QM82YWU87P,"Like it, but can be difficult to store.","I like the sound quality of these headphones quite a lot. The bass is remarkably good for headphones of this price. Additionally, their design is definitely a conversation starter, and people love them. I have not had issues with any hair snagging, as other reviewers have said. The sliding mechanism works pretty well. The only problem I have with these headphones is that they can be a little hard to store. I was drawn to them for their portability, but the included drawstring case is a little too small to easy take the headphones in and out. Additionally, the only thing holding the headphones in their folded position is a small hook at the base of the headphones (similar to those on women's bras). It is very easy undone though with slight movement, especially if you forgo the annoyingly small case. I'm currently on a hunt for a better way to store these and protect them so that I can get the most use out of them possible."
A1GZY49GAOWZB1,Sony TCM-929 Pressman Desk Cassette Recorder,"This product does the job.;however, there are no bells and whistles. I have used this recorder in many ways. I bring it to the kitchen and listen to recorded books while I wash dishes; I practice singing new songs for the choir using the built-in mike;I take with me to play music for my grandsons at bedtime,etc.  It's VERY light-weight and simple to use and has an AC DC mode. In short, it's low tech, but practical. Buy it;you'll find many uses for it, and the price is right!"
A1JIENHEUNQ7D5,"Works great, but seems to drain the battery","I love this keyboard. It has a great touch to it and is large enough to be truly easy to type on. Its tiny and light weight, and opens up easily. I use it to take notes in meetings now. The only disadvantage is the everyone wants me to be the purpetual minute-taker now.I'm still learning some of the more advanced keystrokes and some applications just are not created for keyboarding (they are very stylus-centric), but that's okay, because those apps aren't why I got this.The only problem I've had is (I think) with battery drain. If you have trouble with the keyboard not responding properly or consistently, that seems to be a sign of low batteries. And I haven't really been getting as much battery life out of my Visor as I would have expected. I've only had them for 3-4 weeks, so I'm not sure, but I think this keyboard is a bit of a drain. I'd have given it a 5 but for the battery issue. I'll check back in a couple of months on that.Get this keyboard!"
A2V83CNBP9Q2JS,Awesome Camera,This is an awesome camera to purchase. I always had good experiences with this camera. Doesn't use up much battery power. I could use 8 rolls with batteries. Very good features. Highly recommended
A1L1LYN60PXP90,Panasonic RXES20 Boombox,"I was having trouble making a decision on which boombox to purchase.  I decided to browse through one of the local retail stores one last time.  I couldn't find anything with the same features as the Panasonic RXES20.  Also, all of the boomboxes looked the same.  I wanted quality and uniqueness.  Therefore, I got on the internet as soon as I got home and went straight to amazon.com.  I was happy to learn that there was still one-only one-boombox remaining.  It sounds great and it looks good.  I've had several people to ask me where I purchased it.  They love the look and when I play it at my meetings, they love the sound as well.  I'm so glad that I made the decision to purchase it."
A3UXHFP8UJX89K,Camera Tripod,Had the features I expected and more.Great value.  Great price.
A1242QJYLRKD39,It's fine,"Although this CD changer is slightly bigger than I'd expected it works well, the change while playing feature is a vast improvement over my previous player, and it sounds great.  The programming interface seems very complicated, but who uses that anyway? It looks nice."
A5BAZRN50NOUM,YA GET WHAT YA PAY FOR,"If you can spend the money on a better product, DO IT. I wouldn't recommend the ear piece to anyone."
ATZKPCGDXQVB2,"Nice Stereo, Nice Price","I've been very pleased with my purchase of this Panasonic stereo system. A wide range of equalization settings and the ability to manually set EQ provides for a wide range of listening options. The timer feature comes in handy for me, as I usually tape a morning radio show while I sleep to listen to later in the day. If I have a complaint with this system, it's that the CD tray can take a bit of time to switch between slots (i.e. 30 seconds or so when switching from one disc to another one three slots away). But given that the CDs stack inside the system, (therefore negating the need for a &quot;turntable&quot; style changer) which in turn allows the stereo to take up less space, that's something I can live with."
A3A86P7EFFQAO3,Non Windows Track Ball,"I'm a Linux User, and I needed a better mouse then the supplied one (it was [not good]). I felt a track ball would be good, but I was skeptical of the software I needed (as Linux is quite picky about drivers)Not a problem, the Kensington did the job, One reboot, and I was done. I'm crusing through KDE with ease now.UPDATE:  I've also been forced to use a new iMac at work now.  And this same Kengington Track Ball works very well.  Download the latest drivers to include a Scroll Wheel utility.  Very Handy."
AKIC6OTQ8Z6VT,great headphones,"I hated my ipod headphones - they were always falling out of my ear at the gym.  I tried the Skullcandy earbuds, they stuck in my ear OK but the sound quality was worse than the ipod headphones.  Now I have the Koss PortaPro - 80's chic but my music sounds good.  Very comfortable.  If anyone can tell me why I can't get the headphones to fit into the carrying case, please let me know, thanks!!"
A1YZQXKU5JNWED,An excellent entry level DVD player,"I've had this unit for several months and have had no problems (can't say the same about the expensive Sony unit I had to return after only 2 months of use).  Great for those who want to make the leap into DVD and don't want  to pay extra for features that will go unused.  The remote could be better  designed, but at this price, who cares."
A6X82LWEQX2XU,"TriEssent, Inc is a good place to buy from","I ordered this card from TriEssent, Inc.  Before shipping the card it was tested and found to be defective.  TriEssent, Inc emailed me to inform me about the problem with the card and that my order was cancelled for me by TriEssent, Inc.I really appreciate this kind of honesty.  Instead of sending me a bum product, TriEssent, Inc. saved me a lot of grief.  I will feel confident ordering anything from this company in the future.I can't give the product 5 stars but I do give TriEssent, Inc. 5 stars.Rick MulchinSalt Lake City, Utah"
A3SYHIS0GOSAB0,Huge step up from a kit lens.,"I own a Canon Rebel Xsi. I mostly had just done amateur photography but now my job entails lots of jewelry photography. I had pushed my kit lens to its limit. I figured this macro lens would only be good for our extremely small items, but I have found it works great for the larger pieces as well. The clarity has been greatly increased and the colors are just amazing. Pictures zoomed at 100% remain crisp with hardly any grain. The difference is night and day from what I used before. Auto focus can get confused at times trying to find what to focus on, but I generally prefer to manual focus. It's a great versatile lens for non-macro pictures as well. My only regret was that I didn't buy it sooner."
A1AZGPN2NURCJ1,Awesome product! Awesome price! Just what I needed!,I searched for weeks and found the best speaker selector out there for the best price. Stop your searching and get this one! I bought this for outdoor speakers.  It sounds excellent with absolutly no distortion. Very easy setup!
AI9F70TSNSCFN,"Reduces glare, good quality.","Polarizing filter, like it says.  Made with aluminum.  Has a nice grip texture so rotating it is easy.  Drops your light level so slower shutter speeds can be used.  Makes skies really POP and reduces glare considerably on reflective surfaces such as windows, cars, and water.  Some things photoshop can't fix, try this."
A23DF9ROSHQ81I,Excellent outdoor lens for a 1.6x camera,"Okay, so you are like me and think that standard 18-55, 17-55, or 17-50 zooms are too short for some outdoor events, but telephoto lenses are too long. SO you want a good in between. There are several choices including the Canon 17-85mm, Canon 28-135mm, the Canon 24-85, the Canon 28-105mm, and the Canon 24-105mm. While I would really prefer the Canon 24-105mm L series, it is very expensive, heavy, and large. The ones that start at 28mm aren't wide enough, so that leaves the 24-85mm.The 24-85mm F3.5-4.5 lens is excellent for a midrange medium zoom on a 1.6x camera. Image quality, even wide open, is far better than the 18-55 kit lenses, plus you get USM with FTM, and a wider aperture. However, this lens really is best used in the F5.6-11 range, where the sharpness is quite good. Contrast and color are excellent at pretty much all apertures. Focusing is fast and accurate, and it has a nice distance meter.The main downsides to this lens are it's mediocre build quality, which is a little wobbly at least on my copy, and the focus and zoom rings could have better feel. However, if you are comming from the kit lens or another cheap lens, it is right on par.If you compare it to the 17-85mm, the 24-85mm isn't as WA and doesn't have IS, but it has FF capability, much better edge and center sharpness at all apertures, a faster aperture, lower price, and is a little more compact.For full frame cameras, it covers a very important range, the wide zoom, which often used indoors, would preferably have good F2.8 IQ for indoors, something like the Tamron 28-75mm, or preferably the Canon 28-70mm, which is excellent indoors FF.Overall, if you can get the Canon 24-105mm instead, it's definitely a much better lens in every respect. But if you don't want to spend that, this is a great lens at 1/3 the cost."
A2B9LAM5FEQBKU,"Great camera for the price, but....","This is a very good camera for the price, and for anyone who wants to take snapshots and various shots for fun and leisure, it is probably the best I have encountered for the price (trust me, I did plenty of research before purchasing).  The USB download capability and camera recognition software has always worked flawlessly for me, and with a program such as PhotoSuite or PictureIt, you can really get great results with a decent quality inkjet printer.  The prints also look great on webpages where resolution can be lowered.For the serious buyer, I should point out a few shortcomings.  First, the batteries do tend to drain quickly, but this is lessened by using the lcd screen only when needed and keeping the camera off unless ready to shoot.  Also, the zoom is a bit awkward to use unless you have a stationary object that you are aiming at.  In addition, the lcd screen is not very well-lit and may not be visible at all in medium to low-light situations.  Finally, the pictures can get grainy if enlarges too much - grainier than I expected for a 2.1 megapixel.Still, despite the drawbacks, this camera is a standard in my house now for shots of family and friends, and can produce some very nice results."
A2RI2SW7NCY8F3,Awesome camera,"I recently upgraded from Dynax 5 to Dynax 7 (Or what you folks over sea call it - Maxxum:), and I really found all the features I missed in my Dynax 5. It's auto focus is very responsive and fast, metering really performs well in most situations, controls are intuitive and easy to use, big LCD provides a lot of things to tweak with, exposure memory for 7 rolls is really useful too.I do not use Minolta lenses however, Sigma EX series are the ones to use if you want quality for affordable price.Ah, and my favourite Sigma lens is the 24-70/2.8 EX DG, it really is awesome, and has 'D' mount for Minolta too :)Theres only one thing about Maxxum 7 I do not enjoy...the weight...it really should have been heavier!"
AMI7NR2C7DO10,Nearly Perfect,"We bought two of these - the amount of reading we're doing has significantly increased. Since it is epub compatible, we can borrow from the library, download from guthenberg and google, as well as purchase from bookstores. The screen is bright and visible in the sun. Wireless N connectivity is fast and easy. Web browsing is fast and useful. PDF, MS Office document viewers work well. Battery life is surprisingly good.  We have two of these and an ipad - the Nook Color is what we're tending to use - mainly because of the size and weight. The ipad's chiefly used as an expensive toy.Barnes and Noble bet the farm on this device and it paid off."
A31WBCFWS7E5NE,most comfortable and functional but short lived,"This is my favorite trackball, which is why I've put up with around ten of them breaking.Kensington stands behind the product and sends me new ones each time that they degrade to the point where I can't clean the rollers anymore, but the defect is still annoying. If only they had optical tracking instead of the mechanical rollers that collect dust and eventually become uncleanable.When it is working I enjoy the ergonomic comfort, which is better than any other Kensington trackball (TurboMouse, Orbit, etc.). I map the four buttons to different application shortcuts and also use the scroll wheel (although that gets pressed accidentially because of its position).In short it is a great product with one big flaw that means Kensignton will be replacing it every so often."
A1I7R71A4R6DLO,awesome trackball,"this trackball is exactly as the seller described it, and works great.  i love these microsoft trackballs because they fit my hand better than about any other trackball on the market"
A3H09VQI43K2PJ,Tuned to Perfection,"The quality of sound from these phones is fantastic. Easily set-up, wonderful sound.Thanks."
AH7DLKHSGZKCR,Great Product -Easy install 5 min. to install. TV looks great on the wall. can move around easily,"Easy install!! Looks great and works great for what we need!! Purchased for game room, took 5 min. to install and 1 min. to set TV on. Great!!"
ADXK6H8CTPAN5,fast delivery good product,Fast delivery and good product! thumbs up! *****  5 stars. I had lost mine and now I have a new one! like the one from the factory :)
A15OTC24HGY4L3,Uv filter that causes lens flares and double images,"I only gave it a 3 star rating because it protects my lens, other than that it isn't that great. Also after dropping it a few inches above the table the lens became very loose and rattles around"
ALI6BI422TNWK,A very nice unit!,"The magellan 315 is an excellent unit! The magellan has a very powerful quadrifilar antenna, which can get  satillites under heavyer satilite cover than the eTrex, which has a Patch antenna. The magellan 315 has loads of features, and is very powerful. I highly reccommend this, for hiking/camping/fishing/Geocaching or whatever else! The magellan 315 is waterproof (see back of manual) and will even float (as long as battery compartment is closed). Another nice feature is that it has two odometers, so one can count how long you've travelled from the start, and one you can reset whenever you want to measure the distance travelled on the trip. Very nice overall!!"
AWKA1U7VG4THB,Complete garbage,"Save your money.  This lock is completely worthless.  My daughter got one for her notebook, which she took to college; within a week, the lock decided to change the combo on it's own.  Short of trying all 10000 possible combinations, she's stuck - we're cutting it off with a bolt cutter and then I'll work on getting rid of the combination dingleberry when she gets it home.  My son purchased a lock which used a key several years ago - and had no problems.  There may be good combination locks for notebooks, but this Targus one isn't it."
A1DA98NTSSXJCR,Surge Pro,Expensive but worth it.  The long cord was essential for my application. I could not find one in stores locally
A3LZEFHIYZ1FGA,"Solid, reliable, inexpensive.","You'd think all ethernet cables are the same, but after installing thousands of pre-terminated cables in my profession, you get a good intuition of what's good and what's not.  These cables are certainly well made and reliable and an important part of any network.  You won't have any issues with this one so stock up and don't worry about connectivity issues."
A2ZZQHZC01V775,Excellent Call Quality but Poor Durability,"Generally, I'm a big fan of Plantronics. I've had one of their Supra (commercial grade headsets) for going on 10 years. It's a wonderful product.Unfortunately my experience with the M175 has been less than stellar. I've purchased several over the last few years and they all start out working great. Really outstanding. But after about 6 months they gradually begin to stop working.I've called their technical support department several times and been told by representatives that they've never heard of such a problem. Frankly I'm a bit dubious. I suspect there's some sort of design flaw with this product."
A2LAXD0CET85CH,Great product for the price,I have no problems with this product in the few times that I have used it so far.  In hindsight I would have gotten a step up ring and gotten a 77mm filter as with a UV and the ND filter you get vignetting at wide angle.
A35AM2F6K2IJFA,Color Nook Tablet,"The product works as expected, but the item that was advertised was a 16gb Tablet. I was told, after ordering and paying for the item, that a mistake was made and the advertised price was for an 8gb tablet. I was credited only $10 and received an 8gb tablet. This was an error on Amazon's part that they would not honor. I felt like that was &#34;bait and switch&#34; approach and was unhappy with the customer service"
A3BK586RKRRC67,My Toshiba SD1700 Died  1-Year  and 12-Days After Purchase,"--Read the previous 12/18/2002 review by Jeffrey R. Anderson.The *exact* same thing happened to me.  I bought my SD1700 on12/16/2001 and it died on 12/28/2002, 12 days after the warrantyexpired naturally !!!!Just like Anderson, the front display on the player went blackand the audio output went dead.  Piece of .....  After readingthe experience that Anderson had with Toshiba, I'm not going tobother pleading with them, especially since the unit is out ofwarranty.I hope that this review will be of help to future buyers."
A36GEJMQFKQT9R,Firmware update v2.0 fixes MAJOR shortcomming,"IF you're thinking of buying a player WITHOUT the ability to upgrade it's firmware save your money.  Prior to the Riovolt I had a Phillips Expanium 103 - played beautifully but lacked some essential features - ID3 tag display, EQ settings, and fast forward of MP3s.  The Riovolt doesn't suffer from these lacks thanks to the latest release of their firmware.  I'm sure others will like the additional features of v2.0, but the ability to FF through a 45min MP3 book file is THE feature for audio book enthusiasts.  Also, it seems that the recently added resume feature actually will place you back to your stopping place WITHIN the MP3.  The only lack for ME now is that the display contains too little info in that the track title etc. scrolls across the single display line slowly and too few characters are displayed initially, in NAVI mode it takes forever to search through 200 MP3s to find a song if the important differentiating info isn't in the first 12 characters!!! A multiline display with  a wrap option so that a single listing continues on the second line (3rd line too if you could kill that damn dancer.)Bottom end is I love it till something better comes along, but that would take MAJOR changes at this point.  I will say that out of the box my player contained a defect; the battery level indicator does not work, but I'm willing to live with that rather than have to go back to Best Buy and exchange it.  I'd rather BLEED than go to Best Buy if I could avoid it."
A1ZUUT3AUCMM4G,not a good idea,"it works great however it will not work for those garmins since they cannot take the vibrations, mine died after I mounted it on the bike"
A1ZH0M63JZF2ME,it doesn't play all,I bought this particular dvd player for my son for Christmas.  I thought it was a great deal but it turns out it wasn't so great.  For one it will not play Disney DVDs and doesn't play all movie DVDs.  It's kind of a hit and miss thing.  Will it play or won't it.  You are better off buying a known brand even if it costs more.
A1KA0QLVKVU9KW,Beats any high priced headphones by far,"I owned a pair of Dre Beats, these blow them out of the water, hands down. Crisp Clean Audio, What else can you ask for?"
A3Q0JE942947BQ,Works great even on my Mac.  What???  That's right!,"I was looking for a numeric keypad for my laptop that looked and felt like my desktop keyboard.  After much research, I decided on this one.  The keys are identical to my Dell Dimension desktop and I like the place at the bottom to rest the palm of my hand.  I plugged this in to my Dell Inspiron laptop and it worked flawlessly after a few seconds.  The buttons push with the same feel as my Dell desktop, which I enjoy.  Smoothly and easily.Next, I tried it on my Apple laptop.  It was not recognized by Apple's installer program but after the installer quit, the keypad worked perfectly on my Mac as well.  This is an IBM/Lenovo product so, there is no documentation or support for this but it works.  I am using it on a PowerBook G4 1.67 GHz running Tiger 10.4.11.  As a matter of fact, I am typing in this review on my PowerBook and using the keypad for all of the numbers in my review.  This is an added bonus for Mac users.  The price is right too.Buy this one if you want a basic functioning keypad at a great price and not a lot of extra fluff."
A2YZK7RSHX7LTL,Microphone,The microphone worked great.  We used it with a webcam to be able to talk and see our relatives in New England while living in Washington state.
AFB6TON5K8Z4B,Great sound but hurts your ears,"I've had these headphones for 3 yearsyeah the other review, the guy is right.. the plastic does crack but what do you want it's plasticmy beef is the padding on the earphones, it isn't soft enough.... i mean after a year of use it flattens to a pancakethat added with the idiot who designed a perfectly round shape.. hello our ears are NOT round, and given the tight fit of these headphones they really clamp down on the upper portion of your ear regardless of what setting you put them on......i don't have an oversized head or anything, so beware you might buy these and if you listen to as much music as i do realize that an hour after you wear them your ears are really hurting.....SONY if you're going to make the 700 series obviously better than the 600 series, then why do you design oval shaped padding for the lousy model and circular padding for the higher end modelit really does not make any sense........other than that the sound quality is great, it's like having a stereo for your head, clean treble strong bassjust TRY these on before you buy them....i'd recommend buying the 1000 model or 3000 if you're realy considering blowing a lot of cash"
A2OAYNLNZ6080I,Nice Keyboard,"I only had this keyboard for a short period of time and I already like. It is very easy to type with and love the design.  However, I have one major problem with it - I does not fit on my 'under the desk' keyboard tray. All  of the internet buttons including some of the keys that are positioned near  the top of the keyboard are covered.  Only if I can saw 1&quot; off of the  wrist rest, it would fit fine."
A20JJ8WYTA5HGX,Like Magic,"The stabilization function of these is nearly magical. The view suddenly stabilizes when you activate the system like you've bolted these to a heavy tripod, even though all you've done is press a button. This is how I've always wanted binoculars to be."
AGMMYX92CFV5Y,My most purchased item off amazon,I like this product and whoever carries it.  We still use these floppys and they are getting harder and harder to find in bulk. Thank you for having them on hand.Thank you!
A1JB7CARD01QSF,It was inexpensive and it works,What more can you say.  It works great on my wife's S4.  She likes to keep all the pictures of the grandkids on the phone.  8gb lets her do that with plenty of room to spare.
AG6CWJ1KI8VMP,"Little Player Runs With Me, Not My Wallet","When I decided to run a half-marathon, I realized that I was going to need to find a way to listen to music during my ever-lengthening training runs.  Once I get over an hour, it's really nice to have some pick-me-up music to keep my legs pumping.  The thing is, I have always found walkmans too heavy or awkward to carry and the skipping of the music drove me CRAZY!Enter the HipZip player.  I love this little one.  It fits perfectly into my hand and I don't find it heavy in the slightest during runs.  The sound quality is great to my ear, and although I'm not an audio snob, I think I'd be able to tell if it was substandard. (I can't comment on the headphones that come with the unit since they don't stay on my head when I run-- but with my own, it sounds terrific.)The player comes with a rechargable battery inside which the Iomega people say will last 3-5 years.  One charge seems to last a pretty long time-- several hours. (I haven't been keeping close track, but I've gotten a few hours out of it since the last time I plugged it in, I know.)  When it needs to recharge, you plug it in to the wall just like you would your cell phone.  Easy as pie-- no batteries to replace or remember to change.  And in 3-5 years, I'll probably have been wooed into buying some new technology anyway... (music beamed directly into my head, perhaps?? :) )The 40 MB disks are fine-- I've filled both with songs and I alternate them on training days.  They last about 45 minutes, I'd say, which is still pretty good when you've got the player on random.  I wish there were larger disks, but these are more than sufficient.  And it's great that it comes with two off the bat.  Data is quick and easy to transfer-- I've already changed my mixes several times.The quality and convenience is well worth the quite reasonable price."
A11SBK4I0ZK9EN,Great Shower Radio,"Needed to replace an old Shower Radio.  Thought the $$ were too much.  But, it is great!  Great features, programs easy.  I hope it lasts.  Very decent reception."
A1IZIUT7V00S79,&#65533;f&#65533;q&#65533;d&#65533;`&#65533;sSTUF,"This is actually very good handheld here, i recommend you to buy it because it has a very bright screen when i sychronise it doesn't crash like other TOO complicated machines. I added compact flash and had some of my movies in my computer transformed into window CE 3.0 usable movie item in windows media 7.1. REALII"
A2WR5P2I04GB0H,Great looking cable,This cable works great with my compaq notebook and my sony handicam. It's a very nice looking cable that has the right lenght.
AULMMRL9XITWH,Not what I wanted,"Not what I wanted or expected, from the picture, I thought they were all individual clips that broke apart, I have used the individual clips already and might find a use for the multiple cable pieces in the future."
A3M0WLEO5IACAC,Great bag,For a beginner like me this is the perfect size. I don't own many lenses and this little bag is perfect to carry around. It has a sturdy feel to it and plenty of room for what I want to carry around.
AA8V7SZNIIYY5,CD Case,"Good product to store CDs in. It is not super sturdy, but for us it works perfectly and stores A LOT of CDs"
A1PSBR1T610QYI,this thing is great!,"Pretty sweet piece of kit. Suspends from the ceiling well, the rectracting assembly works well. Some people may complain that it is only 16 gauge, but it works well for quick jobs in a workshop."
ARROY8HWU42WF,"Good, while it lasted","I've had an iSub for a number of years, but it's worthless now.  It didn't break, it's just not compatible with my current Mac.  I replaced my aging iMac DV with a new Intel iMac.  Unfortunately Apple dropped support for the iSub with Mac OS 10.5, turning my iSub into a useless paperweight.  If you have a Pre-Intel Mac and want to improve your audio without a new pair of speakers this would probably work for you.  Just remember it'll be worthless when you decide to get a shiny new Mac."
A81BEPQID9E53,Great headphones for the portability!,"It's a great set of phones, seriously. I bought these in Australia (residing in Australia) at $$AUD which translates roughly $$ but still consider it worth the buy.You can get this for half the price here, so believe me it's worth it!The plusses for this product are listed in most all other reviews; I'll mention the drawbacks to this product.Obviously no one likes spending the extra second to 'squeeze' the earbuds so that they fit in your ear.But they WILL fit in your ear, and won't fall out (I have had them in my ears for 3 hours in a row and have no problem with them fitting).They come with extra ear plugs; which are in different shapes and sizes. MAKE SURE these come with your headset since the ones already one mine didn't fit in my ear properly; I used one of the other earbuds.Aside from that, great bass; it pretty much DOES drown out most all other noise - I'm still worried other people around me can hear from my mp3 player! Though I know this isn't the case.Recommended buy; 8.5/10.Jon"
A2TVPT646OGN4Q,Outstanding quality and support. Slight USB port preferance,"This modem is fast and reliable once you get it plugged into the prefered port. I experianced a system lockup using this product in the secondary USB port, that would occure at odd times while surfing the net. Changing USB  ports fixed this mild annoyance. Otherwise it detects, installs and runs  without a glitch."
AVZ705VDXUO4,Works great,"What else can you say about a brother tape? It works. These folks had the best pricing available. That brings to mind a question: I believe in paying for new technology, but this is starting to get ridiculous in price!"
A28TKH4VA5JVJD,These binoculars are awesome,Great for hunting or watching deer from across a field.  Bought them for my husband and he loves them.
ABQ255D6JXBNV,Yacht Boy 400 Great Radio,This is a great radio. It arrived on time. It is everything it said it was and more. I would recommend this radio to everyone. This is my second Grundig and I enjoy them both.
A1ILWPH1GHUXE2,Great underrated low light action lens,"The Canon is a great, underrated lens for low light action/sports.  It is small, light, unobtrusive, and fast focusing.  I've used it successfully with a 1.4 teleconverter (resulting in a 190mm F2.8 lens) with only a mild degradation in image quality.It is faster than any other moderately priced telephoto lens or zoom; to get a longer lens with the same speed you'd have to step up to the 200mm f2.0L for about $6000.  And it is faster than the renowned 70-200 2.8L II (or the same speed if used with the 1.4x), for less than half the price.Now of course the one thing this lens lacks is Image Stabilization, and I can see advantages to having this on the lens, esp. for portraits or general indoor photography.  But since action/sports requires faster shutter speeds (typically 1/500 or faster) IS will be of little value for this application.So for the right applications - low light sports, portraits with strobes, or whenever IS is not required - the 135L is a 5-star lens and a screaming bargain.  If you shoot handheld in low light and need slower shutter speeds, theCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM Macro Lens,Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM Lens, orCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM Telephoto Zoom Lensmay be more appropriate.(Note that there are occasional rumors of an updated Canon 135L with IS.  Unfortunately that lens would likely cost almost twice as much as the current version if recent new lens prices are a guide.)"
ASM476DCEVH11,"OK for connectivity, not so OK if you want large transfers","I have this card installed in my Linux box. Had to compile driverto get it working. Read a comment from the author of the driverthat this was an &quot;entry level card, more for connectivity thanfor performance&quot; and, in my opinion, this has turned out to betrue. It is fine for everyday operation -- transfer a few filesaround, access resources remotely, etc. However, the card hashung my machine reliably everytime I attempt large file transfers(&gt;25MB), requiring a hard reboot. I searched around on the netand found several people had the same experience. So buy withcaution!"
A14HMS35B8EQUE,Big Bargain,"Nice photos for a very good price, a big bargain for a 2,1 Mpixel camara  -  Some troubles with the lens that can easy to get grooves. This is a very reliable equipment with fast and close-up captures."
A2OCFY81BELYVJ,Does the job,This makes it much easier to plug and unplug USB devices.  Also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in. I measured it to be sure and it is 6 feet and an inch - so they did not short me on the length at all.  I recommend this quality product.
A3ATBL880XFL2J,Exactly what it says it is.,"For the price, you can't beat this filter.  It is good quality and fits perfectly on the camera I bought it for.  I wanted to get one to protect my lens and help with ""blueing' on photos.  It has worked out great.  Don't expect professional quality however for the price."
A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,Super easy to use,This writer is so easy to use! Plug and burn on. I use MusicMatch Jukebox (instead of the supplied software) and have had a 99.5% success rate in the over three years I have had it. I have never had to call tech support and only wish I would have waited until the price came down.
AV2DUFY0CE4G6,NOT FOR POWERSHOT S100,This battery is not for canon powershot s100 as they say in the description of the product !!Now I will have to return it
AACKRUEFSCZOW,Best fit cable.,"Very good, working just as I wanted, plugged to my T2i, this is just what I was looking for."
A1QVFHPY8418HC,It's a cord - what can I say?,"I needed a 10' cord and this one seemed like a good choice so I ordered it. It seems to be sturdy, well made, and does the job. I'm happy with it."
A2MB0PZ7VYLRNX,Does not work with 3rd gen iTouch MC008 (model A1318),"I purchased this to do voice recording since the earbud-headphones are unwieldy and get in the way.  However, it does NOT work with my 32GB iTouch 3rd Generation (Part number MC008, Model number A1318).  Check your box and the back of your ipod before you buy this, and make certain you don't have the above model.I am severely disappointed, and will not purchase any further iTouch items unless they are specifically for my model."
A1BY3IZRPIU8ZA,Buy this - great entry level unit,"It's hard to buy a GPS unit in a store.  The sales staff is not very helpful or knowledgeable.  In Atlanta, TX a fellow shopper gave me the basics of the capabilities of the Garmin Line. I bought the eMap and it is my favorite toy.  When you enter a route and it beeps, its time to turn.  My wife and I are campers.  Towing a 30' trailer, you can't afford to make a mistake; there's no place to turn around.  When this beeps, it's time to turn.  The accuracy is unbelieveable.  Out of the box it has major roads - down to state highways in it.  And, a lot of information about interstate exits.  I added the Roads and Recreation CD, a memory chip and the PC/Cigarette lighter interface cable which together cost more than the unit.  First, I bought too much memory.  2MB is enough for most of us.  And, the detail is great.  The fellow who commented that it is hard to use in dense areas is right, you have to get used to it and turn the detail up and down to suit yourself.  I highly recommend this unit.  Happy traveling."
AFSCUSWXAGJZ,Compaq Hits A Home Run,"I just purchased the new Ipaq from Compaq.  I am upgrading fromthe first generation color Windows CE operation system.  I have a Sharp Mobilon (with Windows CE 2.0).  The battery lasts about 30 minutes on this bulky handheld device.  I needed a newer Power PC that had a longer battery life.  Compaq rates the Ipaq as having the longest battery life in this genre (at 8 to 10 hours...guess I'll have to see); I just bought mine tonight.  The device was remarkably easy to set up.  I already had Active Sync 3.0 installed on my laptop.  I just plugged the USB connector cradle in and away I went.  I syncronized internet news instantly with Avant Go.  The screen is bright and engaging and the device is so easy to use its scary.  I quickly typed all my contact into Outlook 2000 and I synched them all into my Ipaq. I highly recommend this device.  It's more svelt than the palm and twice as good looking.  It comes with a cradle and a housing, as well as an adequate carrying pouch to protect the screen. I bought the 3 year warranty from Staples and it was only $59.  The entire unit out the door was under $600.Randy,"
AE9W1RD8KT0PH,Very disappointing,"The HMD-A200 was the first name brand monitor we purchased after owning an &quot;off brand&quot; 15&quot; for several years with no problems.  The Sony gave out 1 month and 24 days after the warranty ran out.  The Sony was certainly not inexpensive, much more so in fact than many of the other brands.  It did look great--right up till the screen went black.  Your money is best spent on another product."
AZMEWIXITVZF8,"Good name, Good product","I have never had any issues with a Tiffen filter, be it protection, polarizer, neutral density.  They are well made of good glass."
A18WND9Q662IYR,use it all the time,This is very a well made and does just what I want it to do - Polished heavy stainless steel
A2LA50WERWLTM8,GREAT for Canon XSi,"I wanted to protect my Canon f1.8 lens for my Canon XSi.  I had no problems attaching it this filter (as some reviewers have noted).  This feels like a substantial lens and because it is multi-coated it works great. Its effect on overall image quality is subtle, but I am really pleased with my outdoor shots with this filter."
ANDJNRVYFW002,No problems,"Haven't had any problems so far! As far as I am concerned the product does the job its intended to do.I won't know until I have a surge, until then I like the way it attached to the wall and accepted all my connections in an organized way."
A3LE6BSOC8KKBR,Be Careful When You Buy!,"As many reviewers have mentioned throughout the internet, this TV-set looks great when playing DVD's, and it's stunning when watching HDTV material, but after that, there's a lot to be desired. I wasn't crazy with the picture quality on my digital cable, and although I'll soon be ditching cable for satellite, I'm still skeptical about the non--HD channels actually looking good.I agree with many of the complaints made by others, and I hope somebody affiliated with RCA, or Thomson, will read this. They could make another 38 inch, or even better, 40 inch model of this TV, and improve on all of the first-generation mistakes. Make the new model flatscreen, but keep it a TUBE model, as some of us love. I would take OUT the internal receiver. I enjoy the benefits of an external receiver. Improve the craftsmanship INSIDE the TV--no more loose circuit boards, cheap parts, etc. Maybe even some additional HIGH QUALITY connections on the back.A newer, updated model of this TV could be the most awesome, mid-size HDTV produced thus far! It would sell very well also!! Are you listening RCA-Thomson???Perhaps if RCA-Thomson isn't interested, SONY would be willing to step up to the plate and make the perfect tube-based HDTV. They could produce it as a 40"" model, make it flat-screen of course, widescreen (OF COURSE), and otherwise you could have a HD version of their 40"" fullscreen Wega TV!!Sony, are YOU listening??"
A2QB36RNROW7OO,Perfect,I have nothing bad to say about this cable..I've only used it a few times but it has worked perfectly going from my tablet to my tv..
A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,Like A Charm,"I bought this to clean the VCR player component on a combo machine when we noticed the picture from the VCR was pretty shaky. Despite using the dry head cleaner that was on hand, we noticed no improvement. Apparently this wet cleaner was exactly what was needed. The picture shaking disappeared and did not return.Consider this a remedy for treating a dinosaur in the tech world. Glad this was still available."
A32QNTFPVVY3P4,"Excellent quality but not great fit for 22""","Excellent quality, solid metal construction, easy to install.  The only problem for me was that the plate that attaches to my TV partially covered the TV power cord receptacle and fully covered the cable input.  Since I am using the TV as netflix/Blu-ray monitor with a HDMI connection, the cable input wasn't a problem, but the power cord was a problem.  I solved it by using the bottom two holes on the plate to attach to the top two holes on the TV instead of all 4.  This is certainly not ideal, but since my TV is 22"" and very light and I don't move the monitor, it works for me."
A32DU2Y6B2PVYB,Great headphones,"I bought these headphones not that long ago, and so far I'm pretty impressed by the sound provided by them. For a comparsion I listened to John William's Olympic Fanfare with the Koss headphones and a previous pair I bought at Target on clearance. The Koss provide more sound overall. I could hear all instruments better, and the bass was superior. Movies sound better too. My two complaints are that after you take off the headphone they don't stay in the size of your head. They go back to the smallest size. My second complaint is that the headphones don't quite fit in the bag. Otherwise, these are great headphones."
AVR9R8WS3JGSF,Four Stars,"great to have found available yet, no problems with sale"
A18H6KCOM1IPDZ,cBear Acer ASpireOne USB External DVD/CD-RW,"The Acer Aspire Netbook is sold with Windows XP operating system.  This DVD/CD burner is sold with the Windows ME driver, a generation behind the XP.  I tried downloading an updated driver from Microsoft, no go.  I tried contacting cBear, hoping they would support their product, NOTHING!  $25 paperweight is now what I have.  Amazon should drop cBear as a re-seller.  (It's not Microsoft's job to support cBear's hardware, it's cBear's job to support their product.  Not even ansering my email is not acceptable.)"
AVGMLL2QFJ93T,To Much $,"I saw this burner in a store, entered my name for the give away and to my suprise I won!  It works pretty good,but it cost a lot of money  for what you get."
A3KCFRTFNBGV3L,"Ok for some applications, but not really well designed","This cable really isn't that flat - it's about 2 to 2.5 mm (1/10th inch) thick, and 14mm (0.55 in) wide.  (The thickness dimension at the Monster site is wrong.)  Not really enough thinner than regular wire, and not space-efficient (see below).It may be best for running along baseboards, etc.  It's a little too thick to run under most carpets, or to paint and have it actually disappear.Monster doesn't like to tell you the gauge of cables, but these are 16 AWG.  Which is just fine for up to about 40 feet, maybe more.  Google speaker wire for some discussion on what size wire you need for a given distance from the receiver to the speaker.The design could be improved, maybe that's why these are sharply discounted lots of places.  As noted, they aren't at all Superflat.  There's a chunk of plastic down the center that seems unnecessary - maybe it's there to provide a place to attach (nail, screw, staple), but it's just taking up space that could have been used to make the wire flatter instead.If you're willing to pay a lot more (about $1/foot) you can get truly flat speaker wire.  But, since this cable is available for a fraction of list if you look around, it might suit your needs for a specific installation.The color is an off-white, with a slightly yellowish tinge.  Sort of a cream color.But - and here's another design flaw - one wire is marked on one side with a silver line, with ""Superflat Mini"" and a bunch of other text every foot.  It's much more than is needed to mark the polarity of the wire (to make sure you connect + to + and - to - on the speakers).  So it means that only the unmarked side of the wire is really usable - a 90 flat turn on a surface flips the text out onto the exposed side of the wire - unless you plan to paint this.The SFLM GP50 package includes 4 red/black pairs of straight termination pins, crimp to attach.  They don't seem designed for this wider wire, though - they're really meant for standard round wire.  There are also 4 clamps (to hold the wire to the wall) and 2 ""corner trim"" pieces (for making a 90 turn by folding over the wire and putting it into the trim).  Not enough clamps for a whole run, if you use them, but might be handy.File this under products that could be a lot better."
A1DJSC43KOQYPX,Great camera !,"I bought the Sony Mavica FD85 as a Christmas gift to myself.  So far I couldn't be happier.  After much reading about digital camera's I knew I wanted this camera.  It seemed to me that using a floppy was much easier than having to hook up cables.  And it's a breeze to view the pictures I've taken !  The FD85 has an easy to understand menu that pops up on the LCD screen.  The mini movie feature is fun to play around with too.  Some folks talk about it's bulky size because of using a floppy disk to store the images, but it's no bigger than my Pentax K1000 35mm camera and lighter in weight.  And I don't have to drop everything to change to my zoom lens as with my Pentax.  One thing I didn't care for is the ArcSoft PhotoStudio software included with the camera.  It's cheap and very hard to adjust your pictures.  I never did get a decent photo printed out using that software.  So, I started using my Adobe PhotoDeluxe and it works great !  The pictures I've printed out have been of good quality and suitiable  for framing.  The only reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star rating was because I've only had it a week.  I will post another review after I've used it for several months.  In a nutshell, this was a great gift to myself and well worth the money."
A2PXF3I57ESKYT,I love my iPAQ!,"Both my wife and I have recently purchased Compaq iPAQ PocketPCs.  We both love them.  I greatly enjoy always having up-to-date pictures of my wife and child and it's groovy to be able to call up my favorite MP3's whenever I want.  Not only that, but I'm able to carry around a copy of my resume in MS Word format wherever I go as well as some Excel spreadsheets which contain family budgets.  These features as well as the ability to send and receive Word and Excel documents embedded in email make the Compaq a BIG, BIG winner over palm.  My old Palm Vx is smaller, but seems otherwise very obsolete in comparison.  If you are a techno-geek (and aren't we all?) you must, MUST own a Compaq iPAQ.  They are neato-completo."
A13W8OBIL2IQVR,"Great Hardware, But Know What You're Doing First!","Linksys is highly rated in assessments I've seen elsewhere, so I bought one of these devices.  However, as I found out the hard way, setting them up is not for the technically challenged.  If you're a beginner, before you start, either get a networking guru (friend or professional) to help you, or get a copy of ""Wireless Home Networking For Dummies"" ..., well worth the price for getting up to speed on devices like this as well as for a reference for any troubleshooting later.Many of the reviews here describe typical problems inherent in the TCP/IP networking protocols everyone has to use, or in radio interference problems inherent in wireless connecting.  There are numerous different possible networking situations requiring different combinations of settings; using the correct ones takes only a few mouseclicks, but can be terminally frustrating if you don't know what you're doing and what to look for.  After my hopeful first efforts failed, as happened to some of the other reviewers on this site, I took my own advice and found some more information.  A little more knowledge and a few changed settings produced quick success.The product information (including CD-ROM) in the package was some help, but was not enough for my needs until I learned some more basics first.  (Your local DSL or Internet cable service representative may be a good alternative choice here, sepecially if they're coming in to install your Internet access line at the same time.)Networking protocols were designed for network administrators, whose job you're volunteering for when you try to do it yourself at home or in a small office.  This stuff is definitely not PlugNPlay (or Pray), and there is no software program to make all the suitable setting choices for you automatically.  I didn't try contacting the manufacturer; all hardware and software companies skimp on support because it is a cost center rather than a revenue center for them, and more people are gradually becoming savvy enough to know how to navigate this technology on their own.This is a good hardware product, if you or someone helping you knows the basics first.  (Otherwise, prepare to be humbled.)"
A1FKOW5N72UV9V,i didn't buy one--,i hope i don't get charged for this because i've never bought a camcorder.  i'll have to call the company to check.  i'm sure it's a great camcorder--but i didn't buy one.
A1UO6LIFRT9NY7,Great Kindergarten Math Game!!,"This game is one of our favorites and perfect for homeschooling! I got this game to incorporate with my daughters math program at home. Wanted math to be fun and exciting for her. Perfect for adding, subtracting, learning odd and even numbers, and the best part is it's fun for everyone! I would recommend this game as it is adorable, well made, and will be a big hit!"
A371BWSPA0HTJL,Never Use Anything Else,"I am an avid birdwatcher and have been for 19 years. The first time I went to the store to purchase a pair of binoculars, the only set I could afford (at 18) were Tasco Infocus. What a stroke of luck! As an inexperienced birder, they were ideal. They were 7x35mm, which is not bad for birding. You want that close-in range as well as some distance. But the best part was not having to manually focus the lenses. I took to birding quickly, more quickly than my colleagues. I honestly think it was because I was able to locate the species in my binoculars and look for field identification marks instantaneously, while they were still trying to locate and focus on the darting spot of feathers in the top of the tree across the field. About eight years ago, my toddling son borrowed my beloved binoculars to watch a herd of elk outside our living room window. He took a spill while holding them, and they clattered to the floor. Knocking loose the mirrors inside. I was heartbroken -- until I went online to Amazon and found these: Bushnell Perma Focus 7x50m wide-angle binoculars. At only $50. I bought them on the spot and absolutely love them. They are just like my Infocus binos (Tasco doesn't make Infocus anymore), but with a longer range and wide angle to boot. Now, eight years later, my son is 10 and loves to go birdwatching with me. This Christmas we bought him the same binoculars from Amazon, and we are still thrilled with the product and the service. I recommend these binoculars to anyone who wants the crystal-clear vision of professional field glasses without the hassle of manually focusing. Perfect for birding, sporting events, hunting, and other recreational use."
A2PIF6JQQYOGPG,Works Well!,"Very nice little product that hooks directly into the side of my XSi. I really love the fact that if you press the shutter button and slide it forward, it keeps the shutter open until you move it back. (Of course you must be in bulb mode for this.) But I love doing firework photos so this will really come in handy, even with the tripod there is still a slight shake from the force of your hand pressing the shutter button, and this will eliminate that!"
AJUBTKA978SIG,Works as advertised except sound quality is low in my car,I used this to play my Creative Zen MP3 player in my car (Toytota Matrix) tape player. The sound was very muffled and I have to turn my stereo volume way up to hear it at a good level. I would not recommend this device for this combination of MP3 player/car.
A33PPGU2U71QUO,excellent,"love it, this is the second one i bought, great design and works well through varying voltages in a duck blind!!!"
A1JRP4MN35PLAC,Sticky little ball,"I concur with Gary.  I have never had a problem with skipping or tracking issues, but I've cleaned and cleaned this thing inside and out and it still acts like there's something dragging, keeping the ball from freely rolling.  I've endured this inconvenience way too long and am about to replace it.  I must say, however, I now have a VERY strong trigger finger."
A1O6LOIR74X9MT,great buy,i just got this new portable dvd player for my son and he loves it. it allways comes in handy when your bored on plane or in the car. its easy to use and the screen quality is perfect. another great feature is that you dont need to buy a dvd player for your tv. you just hook this to you tv. the hi tech look is a nice touch. but there was one problem. there were no problems! get this dvd player. its great

AT23T76G3SKH4,Sony Desktop Cassette Recorder,Guess I am just a true Sony person.  I always get great performance from all my Sony stuff.  The Desk Recorder is absolutely perfect.  Easy to use and controls are made simple.I wouldn't have anything else on my desk.
A2I8DNFKR3UCK0,gift for grand-daughter,bought this for my 9 year pld grand -daughter . for us ein school and at home she is a avide eader and she loves it
AYDIDG2A0ICRG,Video in and Video out at a reasonable price,Great little card for the $$$$. With the video in you can copy tv shows or movies from your vcr in the vcd mode save them to your hard drive and burn them to disc that will play on most dvd players.The video out is also very useful for viewing your digital pictures on your large size tv.All this for just 79 bucks. Too bad they are no longer avaliable.
AQTSH63DW369X,These are pretty good.,"Very lightweight and very portable. They retract and fold to a very small size for carrying around, and I've fallen asleep with them on and my ears weren't hurting when I woke up. I like these a lot."
AC1E5U201P5GM,Best Headphones for the Price Range,"I bought these a few months ago, so I've had them for long enough to have a good idea of their characteristics. My verdict is that they are the best headphones available in this price range, and would give many more expensive pairs a run for their money.There's plenty of bass, and the highs come through very clear. The sound quality really seems to shine when the pair is used with an amplifier. I use a Sony receiver alongside the digital out of my computer. The sound becomes much fuller--even more so than it normally is.The only problem is that a lot of sound leaks out, so people around you can hear a very tinny version of what you're hearing. This seems to go away in very noisy environments (which isn't ideal, because sound also leaks in, but if the music is loud enough then it drowns it out).The sound stage is very wide, which is typical of open-style headphones. There are several times when I've had to verify that the sound was indeed coming from my headphones, because it seemed as though the music was coming from some invisible speakers several feet away. I like the effect.I've owned a pair of Bose Triports, and I'll have to say that the PortaPros definitely sound better. They will last you longer, too, on account of the warranty. The TriPorts lasted maybe a year before the headband and plug went out on me. I'm not sure of the long-term build quality of Koss, but I've heard great things about their warranty, which is lifetime, and they don't ask questions.Overall, I recommend these as a very cheap and reasonable way to get more enjoyment out of any music source. True audiophiles might want to look elsewhere, but for the average person these are a HUGE improvement over the earbuds included with most MP3 players."
A3CKQJZ23ZWXHO,Solved my problem.,My battery was failing--beeping regularly. I did a quick swap with this battery and the problem was solved. Excellent product and good price.
A3EGTRAIL8OCXR,Great Sound at an Affordable Price!,"Ordered these a few weeks ago, and the definitely live up to all the hype. If you aren't an audiophile then look no further than these.Pros:Great sound!Low priceComfortable to wearCons:The head band can sometimes pull some of your hairs when putting them on"

A3OLQ0SXROI8EO,GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE!!,WELL I ONLY REALLY WANTED A CHEAP DIG. CAM. THEN WHEN I GOT THIS THIS WAS A LIL MORE THAN A CHEAP DIGITAL CAMERA BUY IT!! I LOVE IT
A3PZEZK1G59UGB,Lens ok but loose packaging,"The quality of the lens is fine but the first time the glass was scratched so I had to ask for a replacement. The packaging was loose so the lens was jumping inside the parcel. This is the manufacturer's fault, not Amazon's."
A1SB7H79G18NB,Easy to use and works like a charm,"I purchased this item to replace the linksys 4 port router I already had been using (also a good deal) and now have this set up in my house. I am using two iBooks and an IBM laptop. The Macs took about 10 minutes to set up, the PC quite a bit longer. The wireless router was easy to set up and the tech people at Linksys are 2nd to none. When I had a problem setting up the IBM laptop I called IBM's tech service and received no help at all. I called Linksys's 800 # and they helped me configure the laptop. I am really impressed with the service and the device - good signal strength, easy set up and smart tech service people - nothing more to ask for"
A36K2N527TXXJN,A decent and sturdy filter,"I got this filter for use with myCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Camerasand have been fairly satisfied with it. I am not sure how much of UV protection this filter gets - my primary purpose was to get something that protects my lens under the everyday working conditions. The built of the filter feels very solid and I trust it to get the protection job done. I use the zoom lens primarily outdoors in non-direct natural light, so I have not experienced any of the light reflection problems that other reviewers have had."
A1F41WIKSNO474,Much better the second time around,"I received this unit less than a month ago and gave it 5 Stars. Then it failed on me and I had to send it back. Amazon replaced it with their usual 'superior customer service.'-Many of the comments appear to be from 'professional reviewers' so I read them with a grain of salt. No matter what people say you're not going to get over 10 miles on 4 Watts of power. Here are my Pros and Cons.-Pros - It's a small unit with many useful features. ANL, Gain, volume and squelch controls on the front and a PA outlet on the rear. When I first hooked it up I had an almost perfect impedance with my SWR meter. It gave out 4 Watts and had crystal clear audio. I can't impress enough that a 'good' antenna is imperative.-Cons - The stock mic is cheaply made with passable modulation. The mic cord is very short, but I can live with that. Since linear amps are a 'No-No' get a decent power mic if you want to be heard."
A34AJOQX9NGT7G,Great headphones for the price,"Great sound for the price! Don't be alarmed at the style of these headphones because they are not the size of those big, closed back reference/Monitor earmuffs. These are the smaller &#34;Walkman&#34; style. I was surprised at the size, because the photos make them seem large. Good bass and treble response, but I can see how they could get broken easily. Just take care of them and they will be OK. A little weird trying to fit on your head for the first time.The package depicted (plastic clamshell) is not the package I received. I received a very nice upscale black box packaging with a photo of the headphones on them (in the style of iPod packaging).Pros - Lightweight and comfortable, even for people with glassesGood soundGreat priceCons- A little flimsy (mostly because of the metal band)Compared to my larger Audio Technica AT-30's they match up well. The main difference is in the bass response and loudness.It takes a little more power to drive the AT-30's so the Koss is louder The closed back of the AT-30's provide a little less treble and more of a &#34;surrounding&#34; live sounding bass compared to the Koss. But it is just a matter of preference. The AT's are also heavier and glass wearers will be hurting for sure. I'll keep the AT-30's for the studio and the Koss for general listening. You can't go wrong with the PortaPro's."
A34PMHLUCYHO42,Easy to Install !,Fine piece hardware for a SOHO network.  It was very easy to connect an configure the unit. The qucik installation guide instructions are little bit different to the instructions given in the  the user guide. I followed  the quick guide and found every thing in working order in a matter of few  minutes. However I called the tech support prior to installation and found  out  that they are slow to respond.  It took more than a couple of days for  a tech guy to call me.  The only draw back is that Lynksis not providing a  category 5 patch cable with the unit.  So while you wait for the router to  arrive (that is if you mail order it like me) run to your nearest computer  store and buy a piece of network cable and avoid any suprise.
A1P952SNWHRN44,Headache,"These headphones give me a headache.  They are so heavy, the top strap places too much pressure on the top of my head.  Part of the problem is the voice coil creating downward force.  I literally can't wear these headphones for more than 15 minutes."
A3JTSWRZPZ98Z7,RATING ON FILM,JUST OPENED PACKAGE TODAY.  FILM EXPIRED IN NOVEMBER 2006. I DID NOT OPEN FILM BOX.  WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK.  TELL ME WHAT TO DO.  THANKS!!
A3L8BKVI4J86Y0,Excellent.,"Very good for the price. So you need to buy a tripod, who cares. This is great for what I paid. Photography is an expensive hobby, some can not afford a $500 lens. Work with what you can get. I only have positive results using this tool."
A1N1P6KDWN7GE7,It worked!,"I must say, when I bought this CD Burner, I never really thought I could make my own CD's. Well, I did! The first time worked wonderfully and I have yet to have a problem! I swapped this CD ROM out for my original and it  works the same so if you are looking for an &quot;all in one&quot; cd rom,  this is it!"
A2EKEI62JI28XI,No more hunting for CD-ROMs,"I got this to store my CD-ROMs in after one too many irritating searches for a CD to reinstall something.  I was hoping it would have metal binders like my MSDN CD wallet, but they're flat and plastic instead.  But it seems like fairly sturdy plastic.  The binders can be opened pretty easily, which means you can remove and sort the pages.  I found it easier to put the CD-ROMs in initially by removing all the sleeves first.  You get eight CDs per page, four on each side.As others have said, this thing is enormous.  Lay out four CD cases, 2 by 2, and that's about how big it is, and at least three inches thick.  So be sure that you want one that large.  It seems pretty sturdy, but I have to concur with what others have said about the zipper.  It slides around easily once you get it going, but it's hard to get going; it gets sort of stuck and you have to wiggle it a bit to get it to move.  I suspect that if you're not careful to make sure it's all the way unzipped before you open the case, it'll start to weaken.By the way, if you're using it to store CD-ROMs, don't forget to get the keycodes off the CD cases/sleeves before you pitch them!  Better yet, don't pitch them; enter the CD keys in a program where you can look them up, and then stick the original cases in a box somewhere as backup."
A1K04MMB45FPIV,VHS Tapes,"Buying a bunch of VHS tapes may sound odd, but they are used to record NFL games for later viewing. By fast forwarding through commercial the games are much more enjoyable.  Much cheaper than other venues."
ADSI1ZTQZ4UJW,Replay Tv,"I was very impressed with this device. It will tape things you like even  if you don't know they're on. I love it except for one flaw but to me a  fatal flaw. It runs off of TV schedules which aren't always set in  concrete. In the short time I have had it, I taped a football game that  went a few minutes past the scheduled time. In this particular case it was  no problem but how would you like to miss the game winning kick or TD.On  another occasion, I watched a movie (action) where the finale was cut off  also because the movie (actually the previous one) ran a little longer then  programmed. Thus in the first week of ownership, two shows that I had  wanted to watch were cut short.I wll buy this equipment in the future  when they allow a buffer time for shows to be recorded."
A1GIOGPH03481Z,Great Unit - Great Features - Great Price,"I purchase this item for myself for Christmas.  I will admit - I boutght this gadget because of commercial on TV with the guy walking around the apartment computing distances and travel times to various locations.  A GPS  unit is an absolute must for &quot;data geeks&quot;.  I love being able to  utilize all of the useful (useless) information that this little unit  provides.  I would like to see improved battery life, but outside of that -  I am a happy and informed camper."
A1FVKQY8GQLPYF,Pound For Pound... A Great Digital Camera,"An absolutely fabulous camera.  Better than any that I have seen thus far on the market.  Of course, you do pay a hefty price for such quality (and by this I simply mean price in dollars).  In this particular model, you get up to 2.1 megapixel resolution, which allows for still shots up to 1600 x 1200 (keep in mind, that most people view web pages at 800 x 600, so this is quite large).  The unit ships with a dismal 4 MB of memory, which can only store appx. 4 pictures of the highest resolution.  I would recommend an upgrade to 8 or 16 MB of memory, via Memory Sticks.  Other than that, the product is great, includes USB connectivity for speedy transfers of images, and even allows for full motion video (assuming the memory is available).  As a side note, please use extra caution when touching the screen.  The unit has a special Liquid Crystal display, which does a great job at displaying the images, but is easily susceptable to dust and fingerprints.  Be careful when cleaning the screen, as using a rough substance can really cause problems."
A3LMXWS51KAF14,Great Stylus,This product met my expectations.  The price was great and I haven't had any problems.  Great product for the money.
A26HN8W9NT1IVZ,awesome!,I ordered this watch as a gift for my husband.  He has had it almost a year and truly loves the watch.  I would highly recommend this product and he would as well.  He has been able to get it wet in the shower and swimming but was advised to not get in the ocean with it - as we know people who have had bad experiences with the watch and salt water.  He too said he would highly recommend this watch!
A2KP35R7U3INBE,No good,"Well the formula cheap=expensive works with this one, it says 16-17'' nevertheless it did not fit my 17'' monitor, on the other hand after 40 minutes it felt, the stickers just were a fake, just do not buy it."
A1004HHMSDY5IP,Batteries Shipped Different from Picture,"Here's what I just got: green 2500 mAh batteries.  Here are all the numbers off the packaging:kaardc-4, cat 890 9012UPC CODE: 0 4177890901 0Clearly, they do not match the picture.  Don't know how they work as they're a gift.3 star rating simply based on the fact that what was sent is not what is pictured.  More a reflection on this particular listing than the product."
AJINVBW5CKZVS,"Good Product, but has one MAJOR glitch.","I know I got a lemon. However, this has happened to many people. I know this, and when I tried customer service, they knew my problem. Heck, I didn't even need to send mine to them. When that happens, you KNOW there is a problem.This is not the first time I have seen this issue on rechargeable batteries (yeah, you might see where this is going) but it CAN NOT hold a charge. I plugged it in.  I charged it for DAYS on end. Nothing happened. It kept saying the battery was too low to charge. I followed the instructions, kept it in the right temperature, didn't even leave it in the car, I even did a full charge my first time. Nothing. It was dead.I know that I may have gotten a lemon, and ya know, I don't really hold that against it. If you want to be mad and say then ""well why did you give it one star???!!!!"" I will tell you this: I got a bad product. It may have been a lemon nonetheless, but still, I got a bad product with an obvious issue, and B&N; knew it."" You may never see this because they might not want it published, but perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps it isn't common. Perhaps it wasn't a major issue, but what ever the case, I got a bad product."
A2ZJW3JGGB9IE,Very good and nice,It arrived on time and safe in a protected box. We love it. Fits my 67mm canon T4i. Still need clean the filter before apply it on my camera. If the filter can be sealed in a plastic then it will be way better.
A2ZXPDF9AWRO91,About as good as it gets,"The brightness of the color made a huge difference!  I've owned some model  of the Palm Pilot since 1997 and only had frustration with the lack of  brightness, NO PROBLEMS NOW! I found a shareware application (Fireviewer)  to carry my pictures, now they don't get ruined in my Wallet and I can  carry many more family pictures now! The MS Outlook syncronization makes  this a great office/personal organizer! I only want one more feature now,  &quot;usefull&quot; wireless capability to make this the perfect gadget!"
A2ZZCSJPFUU6QA,"A very nice, clear set of headphones.","I love these headphones. They're light, good looking, and sound great. I can wear them at work all day with no fatigue or stress.My one complaint with them is one I have with all Sennheiser  headphones; the jacks that connect the cable to the headphone eventually get loose, causing the earpieces to cut out. I use dielectric tune-up grease to keep the connection, but I  wish Sennheiser would fix this problem.Other than that, they're great headphones."
A2G7OIBZCPOA4C,The Best Camera Ever,"The Pros have already given you the proven data. I purchased PowerShot G1 in 12/2000($800 & my second camera out of 8 digital by 2009). Still one of the best digital cameras I have owned (built like a tank). The quality of pictures are still the best for a 3.3 M.P. I have not change any parts except the IBM 1 GB Microdrive(tm) ($339 purchased in 12/2000), which I Stupidly forced upside down in my camera damaged the Microdrive(tm). The replacement was in 2008 with a SanDisk Ultra II high speed CompactFlash 2GB for ($2 on clearance at Office Depot) 1179 pictures @ 2048x1536 pix Hi Res. G1's counter only goes up to 999, but on my PowerShot S1 IS same setting shows 1179 pictures. I still love this camera as day one. NOT BAD for 13 years of service since its birth, in daily changing computer technology. I have used this camera for 9 years from dry cold 20'F to the tropical humidity of 101' F always performs magnificently. FIVE STARS all the way; simply put I do not want to confuse anyone with techno terms. If you get your hands on one GRAB it and don't let GO."
A1LLVT0EITJ715,Bushnell PowerView 20x50 Super High-Powered Surveillance Binoculars,I bought this as a gift for somebody and the adjectives he used were 'hardy' and 'sleek.' So my adjectives are 'inexpensive' and 'as promised.'
A36R1HJKUJISL2,Get used to hard restarts,"While I love my Visor Prism, this modem I bought with it stinks. I can only get it to work in the Wall Street area of Manhattan. I can't get a connection from my home in Brooklyn or from various areas in Queens. It didn't work when I took it on a trip to Atlanta, either. I've gotten fatal errors when removing the modem module that have caused me to lose all of my data. I've lost count of how many hard restarts I've made.I got the modem as part of a promotion, so with the promised rebates I'll ultimately only pay about $50 for it, but it's not worth the money.Find another modem -- you've been warned."
A2YZ13TS1OAITC,Highly Recommend,"Excellent buy!  I'm very pleased with the overall performance of the radio.  It's reception and tone quality is excellent.  If you're looking for an anolog (slide rule dial) AM-FM radio without the bells and whistles, this is the radio to buy.  Highly Recommend!"
AFQQ1QJ0VRIG6,I wouldn't recommend this items to all again,"I can't believe paying so much for this piece of ....... The buttons are kind of hard to press and jammed when I tried using it.I got to open it up and check on the inside of the player. Faint, one of the level operating part wasn't screwed on as it suppose to be. I wouldn't recommend this items to all again.I bought it together with this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SNL9ZK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 and this works better."
A2QBT1V2NGYVJW,Love it,I have had my superdisk quite awhile.  It works great!  I have yet to figure out how to get my cd burner to work - so I keep using my superdisk.
AFMQW7ZBR5EXM,Windows XP Installation,"How can i install the Entrega HUB-7u, in a Windows XP Operation System?It's possible ?"
AEX5U5QBGY5MM,micros SDHC,"Perfect for my new Motorola Atrix smart phone.  Will keep pictures, numbers, etc. which I can then put into my computer to review as well."
A2FW35LEY363Z1,Great quality cable for great price,The power cord that generally come with electronics are only maybe 3-5ft long. I have a projector and I needed the cord to go from about 6' high to the floor and then some to make it over to the outlet. This cord did the job perfectly. A little more flexible than default power cords and works great so far.
A35I2SZWPPDJYO,Green Leaf  WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Corder Winder,I have bought 6 of these over the past few years.  It is beyond handy...this is a must for any garage or shop.  Last three were used as gifts.
A8JKSP9SQ6D00,Correction on screen size,"Just thought I'd make a little correction for the sake of those reading the last post.  If a screen is 7&quot; diagonal that doesn't mean 49 square inches.  That would be if it was 7 inches in both width and height.  In  this case, with a width to height ratio of 16:9 the area is 21 square  inches.  (Width = 6.1, height = 3.44)  However, his comments about the  relative increase in screen size are correct.  Because the model with a 5  inch diagonal measurement comes in at an area of 10.7 square inches.  (If  its width to height ratio is also 16:9)  So the new model has a screen that  is roughly twice as big as the older one."
A1OGZK7JDXK6EC,Just As Described,"I have used Tiffin UV Filters on all of my lenses throughout the years and after this purchase, I will continue to do so. They are exactly as described and provide great protection to my expensive lenses. It is much cheaper to replace a scratched filter then the actual lens."
A1LKBYJ88ACS3O,Simple is good,"As a recent retiree, I still like to use the bells and whistles of technology.  However, I don't need all the features of the more upscale PDA's.Consider that the M100 is heavily discounted, in a market where technology changes quickly.  Or, spend more and get more, especially if you need to use for business.Great for the non-business user!"
A3OGS8HRP4J5OA,One of the best.,"On short, this is one of the best cases I have come across for home use. Very well made, and how many cases have a door latch? Athlon approved 300w power supply."
A2ZOM2FKK2ICHR,Very good product... I recommend highly!,I have used this cam a lot for doing meetings (with netmeeting) and the picture is very clear.  Also I take still pictures for my webpage.  Again they come out clear.  The only problem that I have had is that sometimes it  locks up and if you want to use it again you will have to reboot.  Other  then that it's great!  Just because the price is low doesn't mean a thing.
A3OXDFPIX0XJ3K,"Awesome, perfect light tripod!","I really looked hard at the various light (sub-3 lb) tripod options to use with my Canon Powershot S2 IS.  Lighter the better, but I also really wanted a 3-way pan head and all of the little nice extras that I could get: bubble level, quick set-up/tear-down, fits inside of carry-on luggage, good build quality, comes with a bag, good hand crank, etc.It definitely fit the bill perfectly, and was ONLY 2 lbs!  Of course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability at that weight, but I was really quite happy with the overall stability on my recent vacation.  When there was a strong wind, I leaned a bag, backpack, or beach towel around one of the legs and that gave me more piece of mind... but I think it probably would have been fine... especially when not fully extended to max height.Before buying it, the max height was actually my only real concern -- would it be tall enough to take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while I was on my vacation?  My experience says -- Yes, great people shots (and so much better than the typical shot you get by asking a passing by stranger to take a photo for you)!Don't hesitate, just buy this one!"
A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,Great choice,"I have a Fuji Tiara APS point and shoot that I am extremely happy with. A friend of mine has a Rollei Prego 125 zoom in 35 mm that has also performed well for him. When another friend of mine was looking to replace his old camera with a compact point and shoot model, I went to a store near me that carries at least a couple of dozen different models of point and shoot cameras, to see what was available since I had purchased mine 15 months ago. This field changes so rapidly that even one year is enough to produce substantial changes in the offerings.For example, in a recent photo book I just read (Photography for Dummies), the author mentioned the amazing fact that 15 times as many people are buying compact point-and-shoot models as are purchasing the so-called &quot;system cameras,&quot; that is, the typical camera with interchangeable lenses offered by all the main camera makers. What this means is that the vast majority of the major maker's research budget is now going into developing small point-and-shoot cameras. And twice as many people as bought point-and-shoots purchased disposible cameras last year. Who would have thought?This store didn't have the Fuji Tiara or the Rollei Prego, but they did have this model and also the Minolta Explorer EX, as well as many of the other top point and shoot cameras offered today, such as the Olympus Stylus Epic and Infinity models, which are also great little performers.This camera caught my eye as it's one of the smallest cameras out there offering all these features. I usually recommend people not go over 3X in a zoom lens in a small point-and-shoot, but with this little camera, I am willing to make an exception. Although I haven't tested it myself personally, the lens is supposed excellent. It consists of 6 elements in 6 groups, including aspherical elements, and has a 900-step focusing system, all of which are supposed to create a very sharp lens.Another useful feature is the passive rather than active focusing system. Active focusing uses infrared to focus, and this creates problems trying to snap a quick shot through a window, or the windshield of your car, because the infrared beam will bounce off the glass six inches in front of your nose, producing a blurred shot. This means you have to enable &quot;infinity lock&quot; before you shoot, which is an extra step that could even cause you to miss the picture. Passive focus systems are usually sensitive to vertical lines, so this isn't a problem with them. This is the only complaint I have with my Fuji Tiara model.The new Nikon 125mm point and shoot also uses aspherical optics and is supposed to be very sharp also. If you decide not to go with the Explorer EX, you might want to check out this model."
AHAM9GL9DAGK7,love this one,I've had my Kensington Expert Pro Mouse for a number of years--I used it with a PC in the 1990's and I'm still using it now with my Mac.  I hope it never wears out.  A regular mouse is a big problem for me they don't do what I want them to do.
AIUD1ZDBEXAXH,i like it,"i really like this cd case! it holds allll my cds, the only thing is that it's HUGE and i'm afraid to leave it in my car because i dont want someone to steal it but of course its big what do you expect when its 336 capacity. i like this a lot especially the thing in the front that holds some extras to grab real quick. and it zips, not like my last one. buy it!"
A1B4RFR5BLLQI5,"Don't get excited, its just a CAT5 patch cable!",I needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and weren't overpriced for what it is.  Works fine!
ASJROU8VNUTLW,"Works great, but check e-mail accessibility after install!","Netgear's router works as promised, saving you money by allowing you to share your cable/DSL account on your network via your host computer.... w/out having to shell out monthly fees for another IP address for each additional computer on your network. In my case, it'll pay for itself in just over a year. Initial network setup was routine. However, after installing it, I couldn't access e-mail thru my @home account. The somewhat sparse installation guide, CD resource, and online setup wizard weren't much help so I sent my problem to Netgear's tech support. It's been a week and I still haven't heard from them as to a resolution. Ironically, I found the solution on the Linksys web site in their cable router FAQ area! Now everything's working and I can access my cable account e-mail on all my computers."
A2Y80FXMRB2QBH,perfect item,This is the best tape for my scrapbooking projects. I am so glad I found it. It arrived promptly and in great condition
A2Y6RQIIOIZAQ0,"Again, Don't Buy It!","Indicator lights worked fine, but no sound. I'm sending it back."
A3MXIZUL03D20V,Laser Lens Cleaner,Very pleased with this product.  I have an old RCA radio/CD/tape player.  The CD carousel accommodates 5 CD's.  I thought I would have to replace the whole unit because most of my cd's were skipping over tracks or would not play at all.  I thought the cd's were scratched but upon examination I found this wasnt the case.  Read about this product on the web.  Ordered it and used it once.  No more problems.  Took about 5 minutes and only cost about $11.  Well worth it.
A3D511E4AKJIFG,Just an excellent price and quality,"I must be one of a few people still using VHS TAPES.  The quality allows me to record such high quality of programs, especially sports events.  The price is supe."
A1BCT5KJCI6QP1,Must have,We have way to many pictures of our little kids playing with the control and then photographing themselves or us or who knows what!  It is a great family resource so that no one is left out. It's a life saver after spending an afternoon setting up the studio and then being able to take hundreds of shots from anywhere in the room!  Getting kids to smile can take a lot of dancing
A1YECRL0518F5T,Worked like a charm,"my biggest fear with polaroid films is that the battery may not be operational, as the film pack is also the camera's power source, but it worked great and my girl was super excited for her gift. good product, will probably buy again unless i can find it at cheaper price"
A1T8YGMOM0AZ2B,Jam Cam is best for the money,I originally purchased a Polaroid digital camera at a local discount store for the same price as the Jam Cam.  Since I knew the Polaroid name I assumed it would be the quality product of the two.  The Polaroid took such lousey pictures you couldn't tell what color the item was or even what it was.  The Jam Cam was my next purchase and what a difference!  This camera is awesome for the price and even though you can only take 8 pictures at a time you can add a memory stick and take as many more as your want.  I hightly recommend this product for anyone posting ebay adds.  A+++
AX5RBYRIBA9T,It's true: this 19&quot; monitor takes up same deskspace as a 15&quot;,"I really couldn't believe this when I plopped this sucker on my desk.  I used to have an old 17&quot; monitor in this spot, and with this new 19&quot; monitor I suddenly had 6 more inches of deskspace!ViewSonic is one of the best monitor vendors in the business -- they're always pushing  the envelope, yet keeping their reputation as a manufacturer of reliable  equipment.  With this monitor, you can run (your video card permitting) at  1600x1200 at 78Hz, which means you get top notch resolution at a pretty  good refresh rate (i.e. no flicker).About the only drawbacks I can find  are that it doesn't come with a built-in USB hub like some of the newer  models do, and that there is a slight curvature to the tube.  It's plenty  flat enough, unless you're one of those types that has to have the  perfectly flat screen.  My mother, my sister, and I all have one of these  PS790's, and we have absolutely zero complaints!"
A1L8ZVWCS3BWNG,One Terrific Lens,"I own the Sigma 14mm F/2.8 in a Nikon mount, and it is quite fantastic on my D600. I'm surprised that Sigma no longer makes this prime, especially considering how Nikon and Canon are creating lower cost full frame cameras these days. Bokeh isn't something that I would expect from a wide angle lens, but this lens has this magical ability to create smooth and pleasing bokeh when shot wide open. None of my other wide lenses can do this, not my Tokina 16-28 or my Nikon 17-35. And it's crazy sharp when stopped down just a tad. This is definitely a specialty lens that I will pull out when I am feeling inspired. With careful framing, distortion is also very well controlled, though never exempt from any wide angle lens. If you are even considering the Nikon 14-24, I would recommend that you try this lens first."
A2SDQQPLFZ0TKS,I should have checked out reviews first before buy,"First time I ordered a Sony CD-RW drive online and I was excited to have something to burn. I went to BestBuy and grabbed some CD-Rs, and when I was looking for CD-RWs, I saw this 10 pack Memorex. It looks not bad and the price is nice, $10 for 10. most other brands cost $10 for 5. I bought it, thinking of getting a good deal. When I tried 4 of them that night, 3 of them seemed fail to be formatted or ereased. After that I thought my drive is defective, otherwise it should be able to format brand new discs. I then returned the Sony CD-RW drive, telling them the problem I had with the discs. After then, I ordered another CD-RW drive, latest model of TDK, 52x. The review suggested it's an outstanding model. When I got it and tried these Memorex. God! same thing happened. only 3 out of 7 which I opened can be written somehow. all others just can't either be fommatted, or written, or ereased. Now after I checked out many Memorex reviews online. I no longer doubt my drive. I will definitely try those real good brand like Sony, TDK next time when I need CD-RW discs"
A15I7PXLZMC0OY,Worked well,"My tape viewing on my machine was terrible and I had decided it was the tapes.  Then I checked them on a different machine they had no problems there, so I decided to clean the head before possibly discarding the machine.  I looked up this tape cleaner and found recommendations for it and consequently bought it.  It worked perfectly.  I cleaned the head 2 times before re-trying the old tapes (just to be sure). It ""viewed"" as well as the ""almost new"" machine I compared it with. (Note:It can be used many more times.)I recommend this product.  It came on time from the seller, and was in fine condition.  No problems overall, so complete satisfaction."
A3VPVJMLX1X3L7,"Better than porta pros in build quality, about the same in audio quality.","Much sturdier than the porta pros, which I've had and used for a couple years. To me, the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros, but I admit I do not hear very well. That doesn't mean i can't tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair, but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality. These however look much nicer I think, and appear as though they will last a lot longer too. Of course they come with lifetime warranty, so when they break down (which my porta pros often did) just mail them to the company on the box with $6 and they'll send you a replacement pair pretty quickly."
A1XYNHR2LEEVZC,There are better choices available,"The ZIP 250 I've used for about a year is OK I guess but it's very slow and the ""spin down"" time when flipping back and forth between computers (which I do a lot) is quite long and sometimes it gets ""stuck"" and wont shut down on some of my Win2000 servers which is really annoying.Went out and got a Jump Drive 2.0 which holds 250 meg, is MUCH faster, more reliable and nicer to use... I'd recommend that - and DEFINITELY steer clear of the ZIP 750 - that thing is just awful - ended up sending it back after it locked my File Explorer on several computers.  I notice Amazon doesn't even offer that, probably for good reason.  The new ""flash"" media is a much better choice than these external drives."
A1V5Y2NPOWDTCU,Amazing product,"Incredible resolution and very easy to use.  Very dynamic, I can see the pictures in the TV and in the PC.  The video option is a plus.  I'm really satisfied."
A1EMDSTJDUE6B0,Awesome!  Save Time And Get Better Viewing!,"If you want to save significant time watching TV and want to watch a variety of higher-quality shows when YOU want to, this is the product to get.The &quot;pause&quot; feature is very handy, but the big seller is the Season Pass (below).  If you have to put your child in bed, you don't have to miss a part of your show -- just hit Pause and then Play when you come back.  Same for the telephone or when Mother Nature calls.  This is a great stress reducer!Season Passes are even better.  No more fussing with tapes and figuring out which has what show on it (not to mention that it would take 10+ tapes to do what we do with TiVo).  For example, we set a Season Pass for &quot;The West Wing&quot; just once, and now it will record every show that comes up (you also can choose only new shows instead of reruns).  It will keep track of time changes and day changes.  When you come home, you look at Now Playing and it shows you what shows are available.  Ours has things like &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway&quot;.  Who cares when they were shown live, we can watch when WE want to.My wife watches soap operas again.  With tapes, she got tired of putting in new tapes, accidentally recording over shows, forgetting to rewind before recording, etc.  All of that is history.  Now the shows come up in the list and she can hit Play or Delete (if she has several days worth, she is more inclined to hit Delete).  While viewing, she can skip through sections at 3x, 20x or 60x.  She typically watches 90 minutes in 15 minutes or less (she only cares about one or two story lines in a show).It will almost certainly change your viewing habits -- for the better.  You may watch shows, again, that you used to watch.  You are not required to watch crappy shows because that is the only thing on at the moment.  More shows, higher quality, less time.  That is what makes a great consumer product."
A3PJHDLQBKM4PL,Great investment,I am able to get clear and crisp images of landscapes and cityscapes. Would recommend this product to any photographer.
A38JEUPH8TSK44,Not if you own a Mac,"I am sure that this is a fine unit, IF you own a PC and can load the supplemental maps available for it, HOWEVER, the cable that comes with it is a serial cable, not a USB cable.  A USB adaptor is available, for an outrageous, additional, cost, but if you use a Mac, you are still out in the cold, the mapping software is not available in any Mac version, making this, for a the Mac user, little more than an expensive key chain.  I am returning mine."
A2EDRJY7ZJ5MFY,FABULOUS BUT NEW OPERATING SYSTEM LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY,"I can't say enough good things about the Compaq PA1. There's no bounce no skip, great quality. I listened to it while running 4.5 miles with beautiful results. So for problem free music-buy it. I purchased it when it very first came out with no regrets.  Until now....I recently upgraded my Operating system to XP and find that I can't get Drivers for the PA1. Therefore all of the great music I now have I can't listen to on my pA1.  I am torqued beyond belief. XP Imcompatibilities ... not only strand me for this but all my music recording products. I'll end up spending hundreds for the privledge of ""upgrading"" my system to XP. ..."
A3CWU9YONN7I8B,"Run, Run like the wind from DLink","This company's customer service is the worst.  I bought an MP3 player from them in June of 2002.  I've had to send it back to them twice in 11 months for replacement and/or repairs.  The last time it was &quot;fixed&quot;, it came back in worse shape than when it left.Attempts to resolve this matter have been frustrating. Phone calls are not returned, tech support seems less than concerned with customer concerns.  Proceed at your own risk.  Maybe you should look at a nice Panasonic or Sony.."
AVPY9B8NYUMJG,The ONLY flash for the C-3030,"The FL-40 flash is the ONLY flash that really works correctly with the C-3030Z camera. If you buy it however be sure and also get the FL-BK01 handle and FL-CB01 cable! Since the 3030 doesn't have a hot shoe like the C-2500 does. (they'll set you back another $90 or so!) This flash upgrades your digital camera for some serious photography, it is adjustable in 30 degree increments for 270 degree pointing (full right to straight back going counter clockwise). Vertically it has five steps, 0, 45, 60, 75, 90 degrees (straight up). Comes with a &quot;wide angle&quot; lens (more disperse flash). Recharge time is ok with 4 NiMh batteries but I was disappointed at the lack of an external power jack. For long setups it would be nice to run from wall power. The on-board  sensor works with the camera's flash in a zillion ways, the display is easy to read and setup is pretty straight forward. With the handle and flash the camera gets to be a bit bulky."
AJW5FIS5Z8QS4,Keep away from it,"It looks OK. It is easy to set up. Everything seems fine.Then at some point you realize that you cannot access some web sites or some of your friends do not receive the mail you send to them. You can ping them (both mail and web servers,) DNS works fine but the router seems to do some random packet filtering.You can download a firmware upgrade. Once you install it, you may or may not access the sites you had problems with, the only thing that is certain is that now there will be more/new/different sites that you cannot access. Up to this date I could not find a firmware version that works properly. The most stable is a two-year-old one, but there are sites and mail servers that I cannot reach even with that one.  The newer the firmware, the more problems it seems to have. The web site actually warns against downloading the latest firmware ""unless you really need a feature in it""The attitude of technical support is revolting. After incredibly long waits they told me on two occasions that if I don't like it, I should take it back to where I bought it.Do not take my word for any of this, but call your DSL provider before you buy one and ask them what brand they recommend."
A16MYSD7OQ9POP,Second Set,I love this headset so much I purchased a second set just in case I break the first set.  Quality plus!  I love this headset and I can hear great.
A2AIG7G00CWJIN,Best Wallet Case for the 505 out there.,"I have had this case for a few days now, and I am very pleased with it.  The quality is high for the price you pay.  The leather is not quite as soft as the cases you see for $60.00 or more, but is durable and looks very good.  The size is good, a bit wider than I would have hoped, but for a good reason.  The pockets are plentiful, it is a great wallet/palm case.  As may have been suggested previously, don't use the paper pads, take them out and use the leather flap to protect the screen from the edges of your credit cards.  I have had many palms and many different cases, and cards causing blemishes in the screen protectors (or worse, the screen itself) have always been a compromise with wallet cases.I see no problem with the zipper.  It is close to the palm, but the reason you purchase an m50X is for the size, so you don't want a case that is too big, a zipper that doesn't come as close would compromise the desired size.Overall, the wallet scores an easy 5 stars for me, as it was exactly what I was looking for to hold both my palm and everything I need to carry in my wallet.  A great case at a very reasonable price!"
A2J3DRW2CFRBJ4,75' Cat5E Snagless Patch Cable,"Cable came as ordered, on schedule.  Cannot ask for more.  I am going to order another exactly like it."
A1PSZB1WLNNJNO,speaker system,I love these speakers they look good and sound great.  I would recommend them to anyone. they are a good size.
A2CYA3J5K1ZYJ6,Excellent Product - Price a little high,"This gadget with the FlashPath adapter is awesome. I would suggest it for anyone who needs reliable data storage transfer. You simply load the driver to a computer and bang, the FlashPath adapter immediately gives you a 32/64/128 MB ""Floppy""[depending on the flash chip you buy]. (...)"
A3LGOY7YGZN3OG,Flawless Music Performance,"As a professional musician I use CD-rs to make demos and short run albums for stage sale. These have been perfect, and a decent price for the quality. The look of the black disc is different, but I never notice while it's playing!"
A74Z3Y2W1K79B,Great value!,"I sometimes have to do calls with a few more people; and it's occassional so I can't afford an expensive conferencing installation. This microphone is cheap (much cheaper than any other conferencing equipment), portable, has very decent quality (for conversation), and works well in Ubuntu Linux (which was important for me) besides Windows."
A09600262CLBSRBGU2VTY,took a long time to recive,the product was good just took a really long time to receive this product thanks and I am looking for a 86mm one now
AJJZ8C4IF38YC,Great Binoculars,"Purchased product and within 3 business days, the binoculars were at my door.  Amazon provides great service and a offers a very competitive.The Canon 18x50 appears to be a great product, especially on the water where Image Stabilization is very important.  The extra magnification is worth a couple of dollars more.  These Binoculars allow me to &#34;reach out and touch somebody&#34;."
A17MR3U4MPW65C,"Interesting idea, but an unreliable disappointment","The GeoDiscovery Geode is an interesting idea for Visor expandability via the Springboard expansion slot, but it's an unreliable and disappointing product. I had one for a week before I returned it because it never worked as I expected.GeoDiscovery claims the Geode should obtain a satellite lock in about 45 seconds at initial location start, in about 38 seconds from a cold start, and in about 8 seconds from a warm start. When I first tried the Geode, I left it on for over 10 minutes and it never obtained a lock. The second time I tried, it achieved a lock in just about 6 minutes, but that was the fastest lock it ever achieved.The other major problem I encountered was that the Geode loses its satellite lock very easily. Even in a wide-open space, with no sky obstructions whatsoever, the module lost its lock more often than not. It was useless for tracking movement because of that. And I never got the compass function to initialize correctly, despite following the instructions very carefully.The Geode module also makes the Visor somewhat awkward to handle. The Geode's unusual shape means holding it and the Visor in one hand is a bit unnatural; my fingers didn't feel comfortable wrapped around the Visor and Geode together. I always felt like I was about to drop the Visor. I think people with smaller hands would have a lot of trouble with the Visor and Geode combination.The one positive attribute I found in the Geode is its apparently long battery life. Several times I left it on for an hour or more, and the batteries in the Geode itself never showed anything other than full power. The Visor's batteries also didn't drain excessively either. Granted, I only had the Geode for a week, so this is merely a perception and your experience may vary.Other reviewers have noted that GeoDiscovery has reported some financial uncertainty, and that they had difficulty returning the Geode for a refund. I dealt with GeoDiscovery directly and I had no trouble with a refund of the Geode hardware price, but they initially refused to refund the sales tax. They finally did so after a few more days of email discussion, but their initial refusal mystifies me. As with most mail-order or online stores, they do not refund shipping costs except in cases of error on their part.I would avoid the GeoDiscovery Geode GPS module altogether. If you're interested in GPS, take a look at other GPS options for the Visor, or look into self-contained GPS receivers, many of which are less expensive than the Geode module."
A21M4XA7H4J029,"Truly a simple, straight-forward no nonsense digital camera.","Like many consumers, I spent a lot of time reading review after review on all kinds of digital cameras and finally decided on the Kodak DC 215 for several reasons:  great color balance (vs. Olympus' pastel toned images), ease of operation (vs. the overly complicated Olympus and Canon LED menus) and conservative battery consumption. And heeding other DC215 owners, I also purchased the Kodak AC adapter and two sets of rechargeable NicadMH batteries.  Even without the use of a flashcard reader, it takes about 20 seconds per shot to upload onto one's computer with a transfer setting of 57,600 cps.  As for any negative comments, I would highly recommend masking around the eyepiece (especially the sharp corners) with plastic tape (electrical tape is just fine) since the frame's corners can easily scratch ones eye glasses.  Overall, the Kodak DC 215 should be rated a &quot;Best Buy!&quot;"
A2EOH2LQCQPZWN,This Camera is the Greatest!,"I bought this camera a few years ago after doing weeks of homework.  It was the best camera I could find at the time for the price... Let me just say it was one of the best purchases I've ever made.  This camera has crossed half the states in the US, and a handful of countries in Europe and I've never been disapointed in a single shot.  The zoom lets me take pictures of animals accross lakes and then later zoom in on the details.  I have the most amazing pictures from going to watch the bald eagles in Illinois thanks to this zoom.  If you are looking for a digita camera I'd strongly encourage you to purchase this one."
A90YD8MJBKRTB,A Paper Lens,"While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version."
A1H4IVXNXWWBLV,Good budget polarizer,"I have issues with the budget Tiffen UV-filter not being multi-coated due to the potential for flare.  While this is not multi-coated, you are less likely to experience flare due to the types of scenes that you typically shoot with polarizers (not into the sun).  It does do a decent job of polarizing and while I would prefer a multicoated one, they are significantly more expensive (unlike multicoated UV filters).  This does the job and I am able to manage the flare, so I'll stick with this until I can afford a better one."
A3OHVZSOPQQJ68,"Weak polarizer, perhaps applicable to some wider sky shots","I compared this Tiffen Linear Polarizer to a Cokin Linear Polarizer on my Olympus e-p3.  The Tiffen seems to lose about 1.5 stops of light compared to the Cokin which imposed a 2 stop light loss.  I had no trouble focusing on high-contrast targets with either polarizer using my e-p3 (it has no mirrors or beam-splitters).Using a third polarizer (threaded for astronomy use), I tested the polarization strength of both using the camera's light meter.  Using spot-metering, i hand held the second polarizer at the angle yielding the least light transmission. While using aperture priority mode, i compared the shutter speeds.  I found the Tiffen to be 40x weaker than the Cokin.  This metering measured number was also confirmed by a substantially weaker ability to cut reflections.  On flat surfaces, i was left wanting the Tiffen to cut a bit more glare.  On water, the region rendered as transparent was too small for my tastes (even using a 90mm equiv lens).I was curious if this weaker polarization would allow use of wider angles of sky shots (without inducing weird gradients in the sky).  In fact, the sky gradients, though still apparent, were indeed more gradual and thus more tolerable.  However, the 37mm caused vignetting in the corners on the wide end (28mm equiv) while using the kit lens on the e-p3.  The Tiffen's easy to turn filter rim is a bit too long.With regards to color rendering, the Tiffen seemed superior.  The Cokin polarizer rendered colors slightly desaturated and slightly warmer than the Tiffen.  A very slight vintage look from the Cokin (my Cokin really is vintage, so perhaps i should not be surprised).  They were very close, but the Tiffen was definitely better.My recommendations:If you are looking for a polarizer to cut strong reflections/glare, purchase another brand.  The effect you will get will be stronger.If you are looking for a polarizer for shots that include a lot of sky (i.e. pushing the wide end of what can use a polarizer for), consider purchasing a Tiffen. You will be happy with the color rendering.  I recommend buying a larger filter and using a step-up ring to avoid vignetting at wide focal lengths.  For the micro four thirds system, a 52mm size should be large enough, though it would be nice to hear from someone with a 24mm equiv lens to confirm.It is really too bad Tiffen does not sell two linear polarizers, clearly labeled strong and weak or perhaps telephoto and wide.  Two stars reflect the failure to label this product as a weak polarizer and the vignetting at wide angles."
A3SBWLR1G49K2N,Outstanding zoom lens,"We purchased the Canon T1i a few months ago and have been very pleased with it.  Unfortunately, the standard lens that came in the kit with it just didn't have much zoom capability, so we did some research on zoom lenses and landed on this one.  The cost is reasonable, especially for the quality of the product.  It's very simple to use, and we have been very happy with its ability to grab great close-up looking shots from a distance.  Highly recommended."
A283A424XAZCGX,Great Item,I had this remote for a while before I really used it.  I misplaced the instructions to get it to work so I had to find them on line.  One I got this working (didn't realize I had to put it on the timer mode then use the remote)I have never used my camera on a tripod or stapization unit without the remote.  Very much work the money.

A37O3HCMQL2MP9,Excellent Headphones,"I have these headphones, and was so pleased with them, I ordered them for a friend.  I would definitely recommend them as the price is right, and they arrived in a few days."
A3HJGWV3E5U502,Save your money!,"Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers."
A1JDP8UAE7HVW7,Sony MVC-FD88 Mavica Digital Camera,"What an AWESOME camera -- I can't say enough good about this camera.  It is so user friendly that we purchased it for my 70+ year old parents for Christmas, and they are already using it to sell things at online auction  sites.  Resolution is EXCELLENT, ease of use is exceptional, and you cannot  beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling  up the images -- WHY would anyone waste their time (and more importantly  their money) on those digital cameras with dumb &quot;smart cards&quot;  that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software.  The Sony comes with respectable software, but I HIGHLY recommend purchasing  PICTURE IT software -- it is ideal for use with this camera.  If I had one  criticism it would be about storage space - the floppies don't hold as many  pictures as I'd like, but it's really not a big issue unless you're going  out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing  through them later (in which case you just need to take some spare floppies  with you).  Truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediately."
AWHM7I6Q5M7CR,Great little no-hassle camera.,"The FinePix 1300 offers good image quality and enough features to satisfy most casual photographers. The camera's size is convenient for carrying along on the spur of the moment. It's fairly easy on the rechargeable NIMH batteries I use with it. The flash works well. The camera's menu system is simple enough for almost anyone to grasp. The built-in LCD isn't huge, but it does a good job of viewfinding, reviewing photos, and displaying menus. Buy a larger SmartMedia card and you can store tons of photos before you need to download them to the computer. 32MB and 64MB SmartMedia cards are quite reasonably priced right now. Photos are stored as JPEG files, so it isn't even necessary to use the software that comes with the camera. I insert my SmartMedia card into a Zio SmartMedia reader and transfer photos directly from the card, or even open them in Photoshop without trasferring them first. It works great on both Macs and PCs, and saves battery power since you don't have to power up the camera to do a transfer.The only features I might add are an optical zoom and a better macro mode (for very close shots). Great little camera."
A2KK3KCSA118PF,Just what I was looking for,My daughter loves these shoe box type recorders and they are hard to find. This is exactly what she was looking for.

A2B7F5IQ9O8RH6,A Nice buy!,The overall quality and performance of the camera is very good.  Images produced at the SHQ (super high quality) setting are of higher quality than those produced with most conventional cameras.  I am happy with my purchase  and would recommend it to others.
A3PI5UWQK3P659,Great little cable!,"I know cables aren't the most exciting thing to review--but, this one is substantial, length is perfect for connecting router and it was inexpensive too! It's nice that it has the rubber protectors over the plastic connector too."
A1VH3KNUH9XA8A,CONVENIENT AND LOOKS SO CHIC!!!,"I was not at all disappointed when I received my Case Logic Neoprene Notebook Computer Sleeve.  It is just the thing you would need especially for traveling long distances, or for those times when you have to attend an all day  seminar. As well as holding your computer, this computer sleeve has room enough to hold all confidential documents and then you can put it in your handbag.What attracted me to it also were the rich black colour and the expensive look of it.  It is very durable and should last me a very long time.  I am glad I got it.  You would like it too.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE) 27/02/05"
A8LAMHSRCBXJP,The Sharp VLWD450U is a great camera for the price.,"I have had this camera since February 2002 and have not had a problem with mine. From reading reviews on the internet it appears there are some these cameras that have had some problems. All I can say is mine works great. It has a clear picture and sound. I use the accessory zoom microphone and have the sound set at 16 bits. The lens is a Canon lens which I understand is a high quality lens. I also like the smart card feature for taking digital still pictures. You can choose between three resolutions for the still pictures.The camera has a feature called a &quot;super cat's eye&quot; which switches the camera into a black and white mode and you can take video in complete darkness as the camera uses an infrared beam of light to illuminate the video being taken.The camera has a firewire terminal and also there are rca jacks on the back of the camera for if you want to record a vhs tape into digital video.For all the features that this camera has and for the price, I believe it is a very good buy."
A33Z3XUDQ1GNJ4,A good cable,I plugged the cable in as soon as I received it and it worked flawlessly. A good patch cable for the price.
A3TYDUWO6PKID6,Five Stars,Worked very well.
A9OZLI5AHQUJ4,XP Problems.,"I had the usual battery problems with the unit. Rio kept telling me that I didn't need to replace the battery charger. I'd about given up on the unit when I upgrade my desktop to Windows XP. Well, the fun was just getting started. Now I couldn't upload music at all. I had to work with three or four different programs (Rio Audio Manager, Windows Media Player, RealOne and some other off the shelf MP3 manager.) WMA files wouldn't play or spun through the player locking up the machine. MP3s were somewhat better but I was getting glitches and squeals.A couple of e-mails to RIO support proved that they hadn't a clue as to what was wrong. So I paid the shipping fee and they send me another unit. Same problem. By now, I was using an older machine running ME to upload files with no problems. (Other than a small hard drive that necessitated deleting files after uploading them making it a real pain in the you-know-what.)This was all sent to Rio Support who denies that there is any problem at all. I contacted Microsoft to see if they had any issues. Well, of course they did. The drivers are not supported in XP and Rio knows that because they've already got a beta driver up for the new Riot, which, apparently is having the same problems with XP that I'm (not according to Rio) having with the 800.(There is some issue with USB uploads that MS is aware of.) The Riot driver won't work with the 800. So I will make do with my 800 which is the LAST thing I will ever buy from these folks."
AJNHRDUL02GFO,"decent product, misleading description","The product works fine, but it is not part of the P series as it states in the description.  It is part of the A series.  Someone unaware that the ""A"" in the item number designates the series may be confused.  The product does as shown in the sample image.  I would have preferred a square filter, having an area without the effect so you could emphasize a particular light if there were more than one.  Still a good product for what it is."
A12S7V16ZYBX1K,Fantastic Product Works Well and some thoughts on things,"I received my unit one week ago and it has changed all of my viewing habits. First thing to think about is quality. They do not lie when they state that their standard (20 hour) speed is as good as, if not better then standard VHS. There can be ocassional artifacting (lines etc.) but I get  that on my digital feed sometimes too.It is convenient to use, the tech  support is excelent and they were very helpful. I did manage to confuse the  unit once, but just unpluged it and it worked well.I think that the free  updates, the high quality of picture and the way that they have worked  thing out make this a must.Now for a comment. They have only one  competitor and I find it interesting to note that that product (which has  been marketed here at Amazon longer) has WAY fewer comments and that almost  all of them are positive. So My thought is that perhaps some folks are  trying to stack the book against this product? Why not stick with a service  that cost nothing  extra, and does NOT permit the company to sell your  viewing habits. I vote for this product and would recommend it to anyone."
A2WYOEME2ADZAL,A well made product - typical Tiffen quality.,I have always used a UV or Haze filter on my camera lenses mainly to protect the front element of the lens. Tiffen products are top notch. I remommend then to anyone who uses cameras with interchangeable lenses.
A18GTN5ZU74AHF,I'll Put In A Plug For This,"The connector that came with my HDTV stuck out enough from the wall that I couldn't get the TV mounted flush.  This worked great.  Besides being flat, the plug rotates - very nice feature.  The price was pretty good too (even tho S&H more than doubled it).  Just to note: this is not a typical extension cord, it has one end that is made to be used with the special power connectors used on many computers, printers and TVs."
A8IB4ITMQMFUY,Works as expected,Not much to say about this one. The item works as expected with no flaws or problems. It gets about 8 hours a day of use.
ADTODK0KIOYLP,Easy to Love!,"I am a rookie picture-taker.  I never really had a use for a camera with a zoom lens.  I was always content to use my VERY simple point and shoot.  One day, my pictures came out so badly from my simple camera that I decided that I need to get one with a zoom lens.  I looked at many brands of cameras, but I never considered the Olympus.  Then one of my friends, who knows a lot more than I do about cameras, convinced me to test the Olympus Stylus Epic.  I fell instantly in love, and I bought it.  That choice has been the best decision I ever made!  I love the small size and sleek design of this camera.  I also LOVE all the bells and whistles on it, especially the timer because no one gets left out of the picture.  It also takes very good photographs.  I recommend this camera for anyone, including camera-challenged people like myself.  A great piece of equipment, and the price was very reasonable."
AIWGM9MBXF56O,We love it!,We purchased this model a few weeks ago after our 1996 camcorder went to  &quot;a better place&quot;. We are so happy with this camera! It has all  the options that we need and that pop out viewing screen is the best! It is  very easy to use and the videos are great. What more can a consumer ask  for???
AXLQ30PCSL212,Great value digicam,"I got this camera for my mom and just test-drove it this weekend at a car show.  It's a really great value!  I thought that the picture quality would [stink] compared to my Olympus C2100UZ but it wasn't bad at all.  And it's also easy to use, perfect for my mom.  It's just a little heavier than I would've liked for her but I guess that's how digicams are."
AGOL1UIZVLC75,"Unique LP Recording Speed, But Flawed","I've owned/tried many VCR brands, like Magnavox, Sony, Mitsubishi, Sanyo, Toshiba, and JVC.  Currently I own a Sony SLV-N71 in addition to this Panasonic.  The reason I bought it was, and it is its only strength, that Panasonic is about the last VCR maker that gives you three recording speeds: SP, LP, and EP.  I wanted a second VCR to copy/edit home videos and being able to record in LP speed gives me more options and flexibility to fit different clips onto one tape.I noticed the recorded video quality, compared to my Sony and other brands I had before, is subpar.  It looks a bit fuzzy and grainy, at all speeds.  Comparing the LP recording to EP made by my Sony(which doesn't have LP), the colors look richer but the entire screen looks somewhat grainier, like the video was shot thru a bug sreen.  It's not significantly worse, but definitely noticeable.  It looked even worse if played back on the Panasonic, and that I found out was due to tracking.  Even though the Panasonic manual claimed it has auto tracking, I found most of time it didn't work as it should.But another more serious problem, which is reason I gave it only two stars, is that hi-fi audio keeps switching back and forth to mono.  I found that out by feeding the audio to my A/V receiver, then listening thru stereo headphones.  While watching MTV, VH1, CMT, GAC, etc., the stereo music shows good, consistent stereo imaging on my Sony, but on the Panasonic it flips back to mono once in a few minutes, like the TV signal is not strong enough.  Very bad for taping music videos.  This is not the problem if the Panasonic is recording from the Line-In jacks.  So apparently a bad TV tuner is to be blamed.  This tuner problem is not unique, as I exchanged three times from the store, all three machines acted exactly the same.For copying video tapes, this VCR fits my requirement.  So I'll keep it.  Just have to remember to use the Sony to tape music videos on TV.Last, the case has 17"" width, like the Sony, it looks good when stacked up on top of other stereo components.  Only the top of the case is made of metal.  The machine weighs very light.  The remote is a little bulky, with many small buttons, and not all of them are backlit."
A2DBXBDD6EL1II,Refills for the best Label Maker Ever,"I love my Dymo LetraTag label maker so much so of course I need refills for it often! These labels are awesome! Make my house all neat and organized, just the way I like it!"
AI4ER1DOVLOTB,Works great,"Plug and play, works great. The quality appears to be good for the price. Super saver shipping from Amazon made it an even better deal. I am happy with the purchase."
A231WM2Z2JL0U3,I'd wait or pass.,"Portability is the key feature of this nice little (about the size of a beeper) MP3 player with decent sound, reasonable sounding earbuds &amp; adequate volume. Its controls are simple. The USB transfer is excellent with very good software to make the task painless. However, the price is still pretty steep, and to that you have to add the going price of another 64 meg card (about $100) to max this player out (128 megs will play about 2 hours of MP3s). That gets pretty close to the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox price range, and this my friend is no Jukebox. I would either wait for the Yepp price to drop, or invest in the 'big unit' and carry 700 songs wherever you go."
A3JG6XFOJHTISI,"Great lens but ""Everyone I read does not understand the difference between a digital and a 35mm film EOS lens.","When people talk about this or anyother EOS lens and the 28-105mm digital being equal to a 44.8-168mm film, You need to understand ""THIS IS NOT AN INCREASE IN FOCAL LENGTH"" but instead is the crop factor. This Lens 28-105mm WILL NOT MAGNIFY THE IMAGE EQUAL TO A 48.8-168MM FOCAL LENGTH LENS. It instead has a field of view ie:""CROP FACTOR"" equal to a 48.8-168mm film lens. The only way to increase the magnifacation is to increase tha FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS=PHYSICS.Thank YouMichael E. Burk"
A2D65PK1NRB9X5,Plug it in...plug it in...,"I assumed the radio would have a cord attached so I could plug it in.  It didn't.  I'll have to hunt around for an adaptor.Other than that, it's a good little radio."
ACS10ZOB8XCGO,Huh?,Since when does the Palm Pre have a memory expansion slot (MicroSD)? It doesn't.. This may be false advertisement.
A102ADUCH8GIZ8,Fast and furious,"This review is for a Yamaha CD burner on a Mac... SEE THE LAST PARAGRAPH FOR EXTENSION CONFLICTS...I give this machine 5 stars because of the burners with which I have firsthand experience, this one is hands down the best. I crossed my fingers, hoping the speed numbers would hold up in real-world use, and it's true: I can write a 650mb data disk in around 4 minutes. I don't have to restart or optimize my hard drive to burn at max speed (16x). It does make a bit of noise but that's when mounting/reading a disc at 40x. The noise is not terribly distracting and it doesn't sound like the machine is coming apart; only that the mechanism is really building up some RPMs.I can use this burner as a reader too... The only way I could get my Sony Spressa to burn a cd at all (with no reliability--that machine made its share of ""coasters"") was to disable most extensions. That meant restarting with the burn-cd extension set, then restart with the standard extension set and read the cd in the internal drive.This drive ships with a version of Toast, which conflicts with iTunes. If you want to use iTunes, which does a good job of burning music cds but runs some sort of ""compiling"" routine first, which doubles your burn time, you must disable Toast in your extensions manager, and vice-versa.TO MAKE THIS MACHINE OPERATE correctly on your Mac, you must open your Extensions Manager control panel and disable the following:--iTunes (everything--at the top of the window, click on the column header ""PACKAGE"" to group all of the iTunes things together)--Firewire Authoring Support --USB Authoring SupportYou're welcome. This information is not on either the Yamaha or the Roxio (Toast) website.UPDATE: MacOS 9, iTunes 2, Toast and iTunes can now be installed at the same time. iTunes still won't burn with Toast installed, but I like Toast for burning better, anyway."
A1VRANSQ0WF1YS,Protector for my camcorder,"Cheap protector for my camcorder. Stops dust, debris and bugs getting on my lens. Much easier to clean than trying to mess around with the lens. Would buy again if needed. It does not seem to effect any issue with the recorded image that I can see."
A25I9A6TXNIMBH,great radio in a small package,"I got the PRO510XL so I could transfer it between cars along with a magnetic base antenna .I used a cigaret outlet plug on the radios power cord. I also have the PRO520XL mounted in my off road truck . Both radios are the same sizeand also have an outlet for an external speaker  but the 520 has an RF gain adjustment, PA switch, and Channel 9 switch. If you don't need the extra options of the 520 then the 510 is the radio for you. It is a compact radio at a good price that doesn't feel cheap. The channel dial has a crisp detent feel when you turn it. The mic. may look cheesy compared to more expensive CBs but it's functional and for the price I can't complain too much about it. All in all if you AREN'T looking for a Cb with all the bells and whistles then the PRO510XL is for you ."
A1GD7XOBTW91Q2,THEY MAY BE CUTE- - - BUT,"THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM MAY BE CUTE AND CARRY A TOP END PRICE BUT I FOUND THEM TO BE TRULEY LACKING IN PERFORMANCE.THE SUB ADDS VERY LITTLE BASS THAT YOU WOULD NOTICE AND THE VOICE TRACKS ON ALL THE CDS I TRIED WERE SO FAR IN THE REAR THEY WERE BARELY AUDIBLE.IF YOU WANT CUTE,BUY THESE.IF YOU WANT PERFORMANCE KEEP LOOKING."
A2NBV5BCYQWNNZ,good,"so far  , i do not find  something wrong with it ,i think  i can use it for a long time"
A1OSNBQYMYYXJ0,so far so great,"I just bought this yesterday and took it out for a spin - it never skipped once and made my car sound like Carnegie Hall. I drove over some pretty formidable New York City pot holes and it still held its own. It's nice and small too, so it fits perfectly in the spot I previously stored my sunglasses. The remote control is very cool too - a must for the car. This is a great non-car companion as well - the headphones are pretty good and the extra bass option sounds great (even in the car). In my opinion, this is a solid portable cd player with just the right features at a very reasonable price. Many thanks to the other Amazon reviewers who steered me away from other cd players I was considering. I'm very happy, so far, with this one."
AQ7YHU695MYTM,Best Investment So Far,"I got this lens because I was hoping to get a two for one for my wedding photography needs. I was hoping for a nice macro and a decent long portrait lens. I've discovered this is more than I had hoped for and something altogether different. This is a beautiful portrait lens and a very decent macro.Pros:- long focal length (160mm equivalent on crop body)- wide aperture- beautiful bokeh- lovely build quality- fast, silent, very accurate focusing- amazing IQ- no distortion As Far As I Can Tell- little or no chromatic aberration- very sharp throughout- oh, and it also does lovely MacroCons:- no ISSeriously, that's pretty much the only con I can really attribute.If you consider purchasing this lens consider that it has no IS which can limit it's hand held use to brighter situations, longer exposures or high ISO. Also note that the Macro functions wide open will have an extremely shallow depth of field. I find that stopping down to around f/8 makes this lens much easier to use, and produces just beautiful, perfectly sharp pictures.BOTTOM LINE:If you're looking for a very fast, long lens with great image quality with the great addition of Macro, then this is the lens foe you.I've used this lens for some great macro shots, even hand held. But my favorite use is portraits. I got to shoot some concerts from close to the stage with this lens (some wide open) and this lens performed above and beyond what I had hoped for. Focus was on the money for 98% of shots ( I don't want to risk saying all of them). Sharpness was stunning even wide open. Color rendition was bright and gorgeous.I love this lens, and I will stop talking about it now because I will probably shed tears of joy.Just want to say, this is definitely my new favorite lens, and I can easily see it being so for a very long time."
A1SPH5XHWNUO5S,cd/dvd case,"Love these have 2 for cd's and 2 for dvd's.  When we travel I can just pick one of eacg. Can watch movies or listen to music.  Especially good when in an area with no radio reception while driving, just pop in a CD in your CD player in your car.  Fair price many sizes for everyone's needs. Don't have to have all those CD,DVD covers that take yp all your shelf space."
A272Y6VXIMOKSF,Excellent sound but so-so construction,I am very pleased with the sound of these headphones. It is detailed and well-balanced across the frequency range. I am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable. I cannot comment on thumping deep bass because I listen to the wrong kind of music for that. I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member. This newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good.On sound quality alone I would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning. Pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart. The old pair extended smoothly. I don't know if quality has gone down or I just got a wonky pair. Since I can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality. I haven't had any other similar issues so far.
A1RYV7XPU1ZZQY,Love them,I got these for my wife for Christmas.  She cannot wear over the ear headphones.  She says she absolutely loves these ear phones.  I gave a listen and the sound quality is really good.  Outside noise intrusion is also minimal.
A24C863NNAPCLW,Don't buy this,"I bought one of these in March, 2001. By July the thing had died. After a month in the shop, Pioneer decided to send me a replacement. It arrived DOA. This product is a piece of junk, its cheaply made and Pioneer's warranty is worse than useless. They've already stopped selling this garbage and won't send me a new one or refund my money, just keep sending me someones junk. Don't say no one warned you. Avoid this thing."
A18LLLY1GDI7EZ,Great,Money spent well worth the protection of a much more expensive lens. Using a UV protection filter has already saved my old lens scratches - hence the purchase for my new lens.
A2D0GMZ2FKGFFL,Love my case,Perfect for my organization project. items were mailed out pretty promptly.  Very satisfied with product.  Would order again if needed.
A1NG5X8VYZWX0Q,RAND MCNALLY TND700 SUCKS,"DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT MY CELL PHONE GIVES ME BETTER DIRECTIONS AND FASTER ROUTES TO MY DESTINATION EVEN THOUGH ITS MAINLY A CAR ROUTE. RAND MCNALLY TND 700 HAS GOTTEN ME IN SEVERAL TIGHT SPOTS INCLUDING NON TRUCK ROUTES THAT I HAD TO BACK UP MY TRACTOR TRAILER IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE.THIS PRODUCT ALSO CANNOT READ MAPS CORRECTLY. IT HAS TOLD ME TO MAKE U TURNS AND GO SOUTH FOR 3 MILES TO CATCH A BY PASS ROUTE TO GET ON I 95  WHEN ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CONTINUE STRAIGHT FOR ABOUT 800 FEET AND MAKE A LEFT TO THE I95 ON RAMP.THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. AND IHAVE TRIED TO CONTACT AMAZON SO THAT I CAN RETURN THIS PRODUCT AS IT REALLY SUCKS. NOW ITS FEATURES LIKE MILEAGE TRACKING BY STATE AND DAY TRAVELED ITS GREAT, BUT WHAT GOOD ARE ITS FEATURES WHEN YOU CANT GET TO YOUR DESTINATION ON TIME OR GET LOST BY THE SAME INSTRUMENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ELIMINATE JUST THAT."
A3KMFB28AC2YH9,Great cassette head cleaner,Great cassette head cleaner. Its easy to use and does a great job. I very happy with it.
ALP1JUW0LNVWP,Absolutely Great Product!,This product is truly a great product.  The sound quality is superb due to it's digital DIN output.  I have a Soundblaster Live! soundcard and the bass and treble are powerful and crisp.  The four satellite speakers make  the sounds produced more realistic and really enhances the EAX games.  I  would definitely recommend this product to gamers who don't have a huge  budget.
A1DVJNARV44K8X,Great for Palm Vx.,"Case holds Palm Vx and Palm-branded keyboard quite snugly. I'd be hesitant to put velcro on a $... PDA, so non-Palm owners should stay away from this case. Velcro on an iPaq is just plain tacky.Two small complaints: First, my Palm is held at slight angle. The seam with the built-in stylus peg is slightly off center. Really not a big deal. Second - learn to not tuck the strap in real tight because the Palm will stay on if already activated when the case is closed. Doesn't happen often. Also not a big deal.That said, I think this is a real steal for $... I killed a Palm III with no case before I got my Vx, and I like the protection this case offers."
A11BI3S4GJJOEC,"Great Screen, keyboard, modem!","I just got the Jornada 720 and love it. It has a nice - large color display. The keyboard is great... so much easier than using a stylus. The system comes with a lot of great software and even a built in modem. A couple drawbacks: I wish they had the screen protectors for this one cause you still do use the stylus on the screen.... works like a mouse. The other drawback, I wish they had a USB to USB connection. Maybe they do, but it looks like serial to USB.... things are not too clear about that. Other than that, I love it."
A1FYRZ2HUHR2SX,just say no to JVC,"JVCs are great if you don't need any accessories or never need customer service. if you do you are in trouble. I bought a JVC video recorder last year and despite it being new it came without most of the accessories offered with it--things you'll probably need such as the cable to connect it to the TV and the one to connect it to the computer. I had to buy each of these for $40 each--they would not ship them, and also had to buy the software that was supposed to come with the camera. after all that, the leads broke and the camera started eating tape. the customer service was useless and I finally just threw it out. I had owned this JVC product for less than a year and will never buy another one."
AQ17ZIN6A3PI3,Sturdy,"I went through a pair of headphones every six months for two years before deciding enough was enough and getting something tank-like enough to stand up to my abuse. The Pro-4AAs fit that bill admirably; the frame is heavy metal and the earcups thick, rigid plastic, and they'll take anything you could possibly throw at them and then some. My pair is still essentially mint-condition after two years of heavy use.They are heavy! Everybody says this in reviews, and I'm going to as well: they're heavier than you think they are, and they can get uncomfortable to support for extended listening. I suspect I've significantly strengthened my neck by wearing them regularly. =) They sit well on the head, so there are no pressure points or localized discomfort, but the weight is still there. The ear pads are smooth plastic, which make a great seal with the side of your head to keep sound out and generally provide great padding, but can get sweaty and uncomfortable in hot environments.I'm no audiophile, so I can't speak much to audio quality; I can hear junk, but anything above a reasonable midrange sounds equally good to me. I bought these to be indestructible, not of peerless fidelity. I think they sound great, but look to other reviews for more detailed critiques of the sound.All in all, a good and extremely tough pair of headphones, perfect for anyone who tends to be abusive to their headphones."
A1SW1CR2I316PR,Quality CD player!,I love this CD player I have had it for 2 years and it has not given me  ant troble what so ever. I have droped it numerous times and it just keeps  on playing no damage there! I also like the color and the position of the  buttons. If your looking for a quality full time CD player that can take  alot of abuse then Koss is the brand for you!

A3G13L7HR5OJ6G,Magellan 315 GPS,Excellent naviagtional tool whether hiking in the Maine woods or navigating the back roads of the blueberry barrens. For new users: take the time to initialize. After punching in the vital information I left the unit outdoors in an open area for 1/2 hour and when I returned the &quot;Status screen&quot; had progressed to the &quot;Position screen&quot; as required. Give the unit time to initialize...then read the booklet.I used velcro strips to fasten my GPS to the dash and use the external power cable to save on batteries.

A2BAKWNFT9N7L5,Labeling Tape,"I use this 1/4"" tape on all types of surfaces. It is easy to read and sticks well. Makes orginizing easy."
AB2U893HHHG74,Necessary? Not really. But stylish and fun? Yes!,"If you're like me, half the fun of having electronic gadgets is showing them off--and being just a *little* different from the crowd. That's why I dropped the guts of my Palm IIIxe into a clear blue plastic case, and that's why I bought this simple but stylish set of color faceplates for my Rio 600.Easy to change with a quick snap-on/snap-off, these three faceplaces (teal, white, and pink) give your 600 a dramatically different look. No, of course they don't make your player sound better or work better, but they *do* make it look cool, and face it, isn't at least *part* of the reason you got the Rio 600 is that it's stylish and sleek? You can even spray-paint them if you don't like the colors.(Now, if only Apple would design iMacs on which you could instantly change the color of the case...)"
A1EJQJKH29C3E4,"Don't buy yet, wait and compare","I received the &quot;Handy&quot; GPS for Christmas. Unfortunately it took at least three battery changes (for both Visor and Handy) before the HandyGPS could reliably pick up 3 satelites (open blue sky, etc.). Once it did it worked well even in the windshield of my car.However, I travel across the US and wanted the GPS mapping and locating functions for directions. Unfortunately I don't have the hours and batteries to wait for the Handy to locate itself. After 4 days on the East Coast I wasn't able to pick up a single satelite (I configured the GPS correctly to no avail for the new location).It appears that Nexian is getting about 1 in 20 of the Handy's working well (I may be very generous in my estimation). They need to figure out why some eat batteries and work inefficiently and others don't. I'm going to wait until other manufacturers release their units, then compare them before I buy. I think Nexian was just trying to get a jump on the market, but will end up losing with a unreliable manufactured product.Good Luck! Eric"
A280MC5RWWE1PA,I can see clearly now,Very well packaged for protection.  Came within days.  Assembled with assistance.  Some further instruction on how to star gaze with it would be helpful.  Overall great value.
A24RBO2CD86VMG,Review on TrackMan Marble Mouse,"Received in good condition. Being a used item, I understand that everything might not work. The right button/micro switch had to be replaced. Works fine now."
A3VZS9V7JAKNWP,Computor monitor ( View Sonic ),I puchase a used View Sonic Monitor for my pesonnal use. I previous had one exactly like it but gave it to my daughter with my old computor. Never had a problem with it for the years that I had it. I had picked up a second hand computor for the basement is why I needed another monitor. Found the View Sonic brand very dependable.
AYV6SQ7WEPZWS,Static Wrist band,Item arrived ASAP.  Wrist band seems to work fine.  No indication of static electricity now.This item is used for my electronic bench.
A4VA7AY5G19MI,Good Audio - Not great design,"As far as the audio quality is concerned, I'm well satisfied with this headset. I use it almost continuously when I'm working in my office. The head band, however, is not very well made. It uses a friction mechanism that does not hold it in position so unless you can use it fully extended it may not work well for you."
AVA3OYU7GHAI8,Good quality - Low Power,"This is a vary good player/recorder. Only one problem though, the included  rechargable battery lasts only 65% of the time stated in the manual.(5 Hrs  instead of 8 Hrs of playback ) If I didn't have this problem, it was  perfect 4 me."
A2HWT76QZSMVWN,Allows two people to enjoy the same program with different volume needs,Needed a way to listen to television when one of us has a hearing problem. We use the volume control with an extension cable and splitter. This set up allows both of us to enjoy TV using headphones and both of us can hear according to our needs.
AB5E23ZV79CVZ,No complaints,"I purchased this for my DVD/VCR converter combo. The product is working just fine. I haven't had an opportunity to use it a lot, but that's a good thing, right?"
AFJ998SFMQTSD,Come on folks.. lets get the specs right,"OK, fine.  I'm the first to admit that I'm not a tech head.  That's why I always do my best to match product specs with the system I am buying for.  After doing this to the best of my ability it was annoying to realize that this card did not fit into the PCMCIA slots on either of my 4 year old laptops.  The company provided specs need to be more straight forward."
A1BFPBU5PTOVN7,Worth the extra $,"When I first bought the Olympus 340D, I was shocked on how slow it took to transfer the pictures to my PC.  It nearly took me &gt; 5 minutes to download 1 HQ picture, so 18 HQ pics = forever! I checked the manual to see if I was doing something wrong, and it recommended me to buy an AC adapter when downloading to a pc. duh!So, I went to a local camera store to buy  one, and the clerk recommended the flash floppy. I was skeptical at first,  and kept the receipt:) But it's definitely worth the $. Here are some  things you should know:1. Installing the software is extremely easy2.  The floppy actually uses two Lithium button batteries and comes with the  floppy.3. You should download your pictures from your flash floppy to a  local harddrive before using a Photo Editor. Accessing the pictures from a  harddrive is must faster than accessing them from the a: (floppy) drive."
A27WBR7JZXIP8I,I love my KLH powered sub!,"I have had my powered sub for almost two years now and absolutely love it.  If you have a 7.1 THX system and have that preout on the back of your receiver, this will add more depth to the bass.  The only quirky thing about it is the auto-detect mode...if there is no deep bass for a period of time, it may cut out on you. So I just keep it on the ON mode while the receiver is on.  Plugging it to the receiver so when the receiver turns on, the powered sub fixes this.  I hate to say this...but it's one heck of a conversational piece too.  My friends have home theater systems with little piss-ant 8's or 10's.  This a beast at 15""!!!  I have a metal speaker grill mounted on it to protect it and keep the mesh off.  The guy I bought it from said that he was forced to sell it because his wife complained that it would knock pictures off the wall...in his basement.  That alone sold me!!! : D  But seriously it adds a lot of depth to movies with bass that you might be missing out on.  For instance, there is a lot more bass in the movie Titanic that makes the movie more claustrophobic.  Or when playing Halo, you can feel the pulse of your plasma pistol, etc.  Awesome unit...I would never part from it."
A3E7PG9CHDBICA,Light Delight,"I bought this light because the Stella Graphite isn't really available anywhere.  I was surprised at how nice the light actually was and the only fault I could have with it is that it's not rechargeable.  I've owned several book lights and chargeability is a deal-breaker for me.  Nonetheless, this makes a great &#34;within arm's reach&#34; or backup book light and the magnetic clip is very sturdy.  The arm actually stays where it's supposed to and the light is plenty bright.  I haven't gone through my first set of batteries yet so let's hope they last a long long time."

A38QZHUW78W30U,A very good deal for the price,"Very good deal for the beginner to intermediate photographer who needs a starter set of filters of reasonable quality. Fit and build are &#34;good&#34; in my opinion. Certainly not top tier-equipment, but well made for the price point."
A2X06B9TD6ZORT,Quality Radio for Cheap,"I recently bought one of these radios for my semi tractor. I immediately fell in love with the backlit controls. Years ago, I owned the Cobra version of this radio, but I didn't like it as much as this one. The controls are laid out very logically and have a nice feel. The Delta tune has a center detent for ""eyes free"" operation as you drive. The weather channels are a welcome addition to a long drive, keeping you informed of changing and/or severe weather ahead. The only things I didn't care that much for are the Dynamic Squelch feature and the front mic connector. DSC doesn't seem to work too well, but I drive with the squelch off (to hear distant signals), so this doesn't detract from an otherwise great radio. Having owned various Cobras, Galaxies, and other ""big"" radios, I can honestly say I like the Uniden PC78LTW the best."
A17YSE1UQF24GJ,"If you have CDMA PCS 3G Wireless Service, this is a must...","I work for a CDMA PCS carrier here in Puerto Rico, it works great with the Gtran Dot.Surfer PCMCIA card.

If you need to connect via mobile to the net or your business, this is a must!!"
A1VCQZI66AC8RX,Don't last very long - update - use heat shrink tubing,"I really like these ear buds, they sound pretty good, and they are very comfortable in my small ears.  I hate the cheap ones that came with my mp3 player and don't care too much for the silicon ear buds, most of them hurt my ears and don't stay in very well.  These stay in really well when I'm at the gym even.  The only problem is that they haven't been lasting me more than 2-3 months lately.  I've gone through two pair of these and 1 pair of the white Koss Spark Plugs, none of them made it 3 months.  In their defense I have been using them daily on the train to and from work, at my desk throughout the day, and at the gym 4-5 times a week.  They might last longer if they had a 90 degree L-shaped plug to go into the mp3, that's where they seem to lose their connection.  I'm going to try to put some heat shrink tubing on my next pair to see if it helps reduce the strain on that part of the cord.********Update 3/14/12********I don't want to jinx it here, knocks on wood, but my latest pair are still going strong after about 8 months.  I don't know if I got lucky or if it's the heat shrink tubing I added.  I did that right when I got them, just a small piece about 1 1/2"" long on the plug end.  It didn't shrink tight on the cord, but it is in the larger diameter connector.  It slides down onto the cord occasionally and I just push it back up.  It prevents wear and tear on the cord coming out of the connector.  I use them daily at work, on the train, and at the gym and have had no problems with this pair so far."
A2R1CKF6R9Y8FB,Tiffen 37mm UV Filter,"I like the idea of protective filters.  This arrived quickly in time for vacation, and seems to work fine.  I recommend protective filters for all dsl lenses."

A3NP39QDKNKMA2,Hit and Miss,"When I read about the Ceiva, it was exactly what I was looking for... an easy way to keep my family up to date with pictures, without having to mail them. The concept is great, but I was not very pleased with the performance or customer service. I have seen other frames that are linked directly to computers, which is the quality I was expecting on my Ceiva. This was definetely not the case. I order 4 units initially, but had to return 2 of them because the flickering was so bad it was difficult to see the picture. I received another 2 replacement units...and sure enough, 1 of those the flickering is bad enough that I am going to send it back as well. The flickering is definitely one issue that Ceiva needs to work out. &lt;"
A300J3U2DV333A,A partial fix to my 05/15/2001 complaint of flash pix,"I called Nikon recently to complain about the flash picture problems I wrote on 05/15/2001. I got a quick but partial solution. The solution works only in Manual REC mode: 1. Select M-REC mode; 2. Press MENU button; 3. Select RESET ALL (to the default values); 4. Set SENS to 200 or 400. The Manual flash picture is much better (about 15-20 feet vs 10 feet). But, the Auto flash and the SLOW SYNC are still problems. Daylight pictures are excellent. Nikon did a very poor job in quality control and in communicating this problem to their registered customers. My experience shaked my confidence to all other Nikon products."
A4PCDQP5HQ0N2,Excellent,Excellent! I already own a 50 Capacity Case Logic. Find them very useful and convenient. It's worth the money. Will eventually buy another one.
A1ZMOUZK398428,Great little camera for travelling,"Pros: Small size fits in a coat pocket; one-handed operation; ease of use makes it useful on hikes and climbs.Cons: Unsophisticated focus means that quite a few pictures are not quite crisp; automatic flash makes it impossible to photograph anything but close-ups in low-light conditions - for instance, photos of the final red rays of sunset won't come out.I used this camera on several trips to Europe, and although I wasn't happy with the way some (say, 15%) of the pictures came out, I would never have taken most of them with my bulky 35mmm manual focus camera.  So this camera is a good choice for travelling, especially if you want some pictures, but don't want to go to a lot of trouble taking them."
A1QQVV5VG0FG4W,The Best DVD/CD Storage System Available - But It Could Be Better,"I purchased this very large DVD/CD wallet to better organize and store my DVD collection so that I could avoid having a large cabinet in my living room full of standard DVD cases.  My problem with most systems is the inability to add pages between existing pages as my DVD collection expands, resulting in the need to physically move dozens of discs around just to make room for a few new ones in the middle of the wallet.This system solves that problem because it has a mechanism that allows the pages to be released and moved around.  However, rather than simply having a standard ring binder system that opens in the middle, the pages are held by wide plastic strips that are permanently attached to the back of the wallet, and release from the front.  That means to add a page to the middle, you must remove all of the pages towards the front of the wallet and later re-insert them, which is a hassle because the wide plastic strips are awkward to re-thread through the narrow slots in the pages.However, this is just a quibble rather than a serious limitation.  I have purchased numerous systems in the past, and this one is the best I have found by far.  The wallet has enormous capacity and seems to be durably constructed.  It is incredibly convenient to have all of my DVDs in such a compact space.  I hope someday to find a CD/DVD wallet with a standard three-ring binder retaining system, but until that happens, this is the best storage system available."
A1Z61TUQFZYVFQ,cd player with alot of twist!,"after waiting for two weeks until i got it three days ago, it was great! i  had to have someone purchased it online for me in the states then have it  shipped to the philippines and it was really worth the wait.  i can't make  it skip! been tapping, shaking and slapping it...it really won't skip!  this is a must have low cost portable cd player.  there are only two things  that i wish it had, one is the car adapter kit and the other is the smaller  adjustments on the jogger grip (we asians have smaller hands that is why).  other than that, the player is perfect for people on a tight budget.  by  the way, it also delivers clear sound quality even on pirated cd's (havn't  tried it on cdr's but i'm hoping it will work).  i've been wanting to have  a portable cd player that has a tuner as well but hey why ask more when i  can only afford 70 bucks!  overall, this panasonic slsx275 is a portable cd  player worth it's price.  if you're looking for a cd player that is branded  with good quality at a low price, go for this one, you won't regret it!  better get one now before it goes out of stock again! -- hi hon!

A3IIYC4PF1DTG9,"Baby got BOOM, but not separate volume control.","These speakers stunned me. When my tiny &quot;came with the PC&quot; speakers died, I looked into getting some similar little speakers, but then realized that I could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set.First, let me say that the subwoofer BOOOMS! The bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system. Really remarkable. I used this system in my dorm room at Columbia University this summer, and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching DVDs, and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine. With the massive BOOOOM of the system, it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic.My only complaint, in fact, is that BOOM! The subwoofer doesn't have an independent volume control, so if I turn up the volume on the little speakers, the subwoofer follows right along, thunderously loud. A separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect."

A7K8TNJSI2JN8,Its scroll is the worst among Logitech optical mouse,"The scroll is heavy, noisy and gets stuck sometimes especially forward. I have a cheaper white Logitech optical mice(USB/PS2) and it works great. The only thing I don't like from this previous mice is its bright color. So I bought this black one. Movement is the same but I could not scroll smoothly like the  Logitech Optical Mouse (USB/PS2). It doesn't worth to return the item but I hate to touch the scroll of this mice. Try at a shop before you decide to buy it."

A30HVMUWA1W3JC,What Sony should do...,"... about the slow shutter issue.  Embed a memory stick/flash card in addition to Cd-r capability.  I suspect that the shutter issue is due to cd-burning limitations and therefore would be really hard to address on a portable device (it is meant for stationary platforms -- pc, stereos, etc.).  If you embed a memory stick that flushes the data to cd-r, then you get the best of both worlds -- speed of flash memory and the portability of cd-r!"

A256S0SNCGFKGC,This product is a gamble at best,"I originally bought last year's model of this recorder from Philips.  And after a few months, it simply stopped recording on CDR's and half the functions became completely unreliable.  So i sent it back to the manufacturer (because it was under the one-year warranty) where it sat in their factory for over a month.  They later returned it to me and claimed that there were ""no apparent problems with the recorder.""  Like a naive idiot, I took their word for it and brought it home again.  When I plugged it in and tried recording, I found that the original problem had clearly been ignored by Philips, and, to make it even sweeter, the factory had somehow created an entirely new malfunction whereby the unit sporadically and suddenly turns its power off...and yes, even in the middle of recording a CD.  So, the next day, I sent it back to the factory.  And after having sat somewhere in the same factory for an additional 6 weeks, Philips told me that they didn't know how to fix the problem, and would be sending me a brand new unit (this CDR820).  ""Pretty cool"" I thought.  Until I got the unit and tried some basic recording.  The unit worked fine one minute, and then almost on cue, the unit started giving me unexplained error messages (NOT talked about in the owner's manual) and all of the buttons on the recorder ceased to respond in any way.  Incidently, if you ever need a good laugh, call the Philips consumer electronics customer service hotline and explain a simple problem your product is having, and listen to their expert advice.  Well, needless to say, I pawned the CDR for chump change but since then I've slept like a baby now that the cursed machine is out of my life forever.  Please, please, please listen to my advice and do what I wish I had done over a year and a few hundred dollars ago: avoid this brand for CD recording equipment."
A3QHSRH7PB0NGN,"High quality, but a little clumsy","I've used this switch for about 6 months.  It's stylish and reliable. The switch and cables are high-quality; image quality is nearly as good as what you see on the much more expensive Belkin KVM switches.The switch is relatively light-weight; when you press the button to switch computers, you'll likely scoot the switch across your desk unless you hold it in place.My biggest gripe about this switch is the absolutely insane keyboard shortcuts. Pressing the shift key twice in a row switches displays--just like hitting the button on the switch. The upside here is that it's very easy to switch between computers; the downside is that you'll probably inadvertantly switch all the time! Worse still, the double-shift shortcut isn't documented, and it took me a couple months of frustration with &quot;random switching&quot; to figure out exactly what was going on.In terms of price/performance, the Linksys KVM unit outperforms all others on the market: The Belkin units offer slightly better picture quality and better keyboard shortcuts, but at a much higher price. The old &quot;Data Switch&quot; KVM switchboxes are less expensive, but the ghosting is so bad that the switch is basically unusable at more than 640x480."
A3H13BKE90ABBD,Everything You Need,"I got the Rio Volt after many trials with different MP3 portable players.  I wanted a unit that would hold lots of music, so that ruled out the solid-state memory type players.  So, I was down to either MP3CD players or harddrive based units.  I went through:  Pine D'Music's SM-200C MP3CD player (cruddy sound, short battery life, skipped badly), Creative's Jukebox (good sound, lots of storage, short battery life), and Archo's Jukebox 6000 (tinny sound, some hardware/software problems, decent battery life).  Then I got the Rio Volt and that's what I've been happy with ever since I broke it out of the bubble packaging.  This player does it all, you can put CD-R or CD-RW in it.  It supports multiple formats of discs (ISO and DirectCD being the two biggies).  It supports multiple encoding bit rates (up to 320kbits).  It supports variable bit rates.  Its firmware is upgradeable easily so that it'll support future standards.  The little remote control is handy.  It sounds great and best of all I can get 14-15 hours on a pair of AA batteries!  If you are not using your MP3 portable while exercising or during physical activity then the Rio Volt is the machine for you."

I was so amazed I purchased another Sima lens pen from amazon.com just for my glasses and I carry it with me whenever I leave home.

A2C2OYVOOKPCKT,Cheap,"After bolting the cable to the wall, I attempted to set the combination. In order to choose the combination you want, you use a flat head screw driver to unscrew and loosen the lock so you can rotate the number dials. Then, just tighten it up again. I did this. However, when I went to test out the combination I set, it didn't work! And when I went to unscrew it to reset it, my attempts at unscrewing the cheap screw stripped the head and I was unable to reset it. I called the company and they said they would replace it but only if I sent them the old one. Now I have to spend my time and my money to get a cheap lock replaced. And, based on the other reviews of locks spontaneously changing combinations anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if this happened again."
A3B99SRJB9W00M,Solid and dependable...Kodak DC 290,"This is my third digital camera. I started with a Kodak 1.1 mpix, then to a Polaroid 1.3. I began to read reviews about the DC 290 from several pros and casual users. All reviews were five star as to use, programing, and dependability.I like the size of the camera and the easy menu. The good, better, and best settings are easy and the 2.1 resolution (compressed) pics are of high quality on better, but the lower res work well when sending pics by e-mail. The TIFF (uncompressed) delivers great 8 by 10s on my HP PhotoSmart 1115CV printer. All buttons, ports, switches, etc. are top dollar. One complaint is the flexable cover over the LCD, I would rather it were glass for easy cleaning (Scotch Tape does the cleaning job however)! Also the fash can wash out pics indoors so I use a shoe with my SLR flash. Also I use PhotoShop and MS PictureIt to work with my pics.This will be a camera I will not sell even though it does not do video. I use a Camedia 3040 at work and the vid is not that great. The DC 290 does allow for audio (15 sec) on pics, and the programming feature is great (I just downloaded a bracketing feature). I got the camera for $225.00 through a Amazon.com source. The box had been opened but never used as all batteries and materials wer still in their bags and wrapping. If you can find one, this is a terrific but. Its bullet proof and not too bad on batteries (I have two sets of NIMH and the charger that comes with the system). Five Star for me!!!"

AUNP1OLUJB9R2,"Great product, terrible installation","The DirecTV system itself is fantastic!  However, if you live in the Chicago area, you would do better to wait for a different promotion.  The so-called &quot;professional free installation&quot; is anything but professional.  Apparently Amazon contracts out the installation work to a company called Digivision, who in turn, subcontracts the work out to local installers.The first installer was to arrive on Aug. 27th (the system was shipped to us on Aug. 10th).  He called that day to inform us that his car broke down, and he had no idea when he would be able to make it.  He never called again, and never returned our calls.Then, I contacted Digivision to get a different installer.  I called him on 3 different days last week, and never had a call returned.Totally frustrated, I stopped by our local TV repair shop to ask if they do satellite installations.  They did, and came out the very next morning to complete the installation.  So, the &quot;free installation&quot; cost me $199."
A3569247WI8WOK,great product,"This is the best headset ive ever bought.  Panasonic makes one very similar, but more expensive.  The truth is, with the panasonic one your paying for the name.

I use it with the Panasonic KX-TG2563B Phone.  TRUST ME, youll like this product."
A23VTC6VKNFZVE,EASY TO USE,"This camera has worked on my mind for a few years now ever since its introduction in 1999.  As a long time Nikon owner, I avioded buying one.  I mean it's not the most beautiful camera in the world.  But at last it began to look good to me, I mean really good and I decided I must own one.  But, alas, they are nearly out of production.  I had to settle for a well cared for used one.  The camera works like a dream.  The controls are easy to locate and easy to use, even in the dark.  They glow.  There is a limited production still available in stainless and titanium and I think the Dynax european edition is still available if you can locate one.  The limited edition sells for ahefty $2500. and is currently back ordered.  Get one if you can and the heck with anyone who tells you its not pro and ugly."
A1535Z95X313JW,You Can Disregard Other Reviews because...,"For example, &#34;lens missing&#34; applies to some other seller of this product as &#34;used&#34;--NOT ME!I'm listing this product as a &#34;like new&#34; used item and Amazon consolidates these listings under a single link.I have no connection to past sellers of the Kodak Carousel 5600.If other reviews discuss features and design for the same Model Number, then yes--that applies to what I'm selling."
A3PQTACX41J5J6,The best Headphones for DJ/Music,"This headphones are great, the sound is the best I heard for dj headphones period.  I have used the top of the line pioneers, not a fan.  But the 350 -400 dollar price is crazy.  They use to go for 120 until they were discontinued.  So basically someone ripping you off to the max, what a greedy scumbag.  But hey you if you got money to burn, do it.  My did break after 5 years of heavy use. Where the headband and the earphones meet.  Had to but gorilla glue on them and now are just fine."
A1WGO1V9U1E51J,Easily the best headphones under $50,"These headphones have great sound, really good bass, and the adjustment is nice and comfortable. The pads are soft, don't wear out. They might feel a little cheap (the actual speakers are in kind of a flimsy plastic cabinet), but there is just no better sound under $50. They don't just sound good, they sound great.In the end, can you really argue with more than 1100 reviews with nearly a 4.5 star average?"
A3TLV6X0NJV934,"great lens, but I wish it had Image Stabilization","I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures."
A1YOSXL5F6KEBJ,Don't bother,"Great price, right?  Wrong. It will cost you time, and hassle, and in the end, very likely you will need to return the useless object.I installed three different motion detector lights last week.  The Health Zenith Halogen light seems pretty good, but this one is just junk.Wasted my time installing it, and discovered that this particular unit was apparently stuck in a state wherein it strobes on and off a few seconds at a time, and the motion detection is immaterial to the strobing. No amount of resetting puts it in a useful state. In theory, you should be able to put the unit back in ""Auto"" mode by shutting the power off for the requisite time period, but something's wrong with this one. The screw holes in the gasket that came with it was already punched out-- unlike other lights from the same manufacturer received at the same time-- so I wonder if this one had been returned before and sent out again.Nothing shrieks, ""Nobody's home!"" like a porch light that strobes on/off in short intervals until someone just shuts off the power and puts it out of its misery.No wonder they're on ""clearance"".  Don't waste your time."
AGWTK8L59V3GO,"JUST BUY THEM, You won't be sorry.","I bought another brand of headphones for my MP3 player, and was not happy.  I returned them the next day.  After that I decided if I couldn't try them out, I would have to find a good pair by reading reviews. For the price of these headphones I don't believe you will find a better pair.  I am very happy with these headphones, and am so glad I bought them.  Ear buds hurt my ears after a while, so I had to get headphones. These headphones can be used for MP3, computer, or stereo etc...The Sony MDR-V6 sound good, and they are very comfortable.  Plus they come with a bag, and a adapter!  The fit is incredible.  I feel like they were made just for me.  Sony did a great job with these headphones, and they should be on the market for many years to come.  Bravo Zulu."
A1ZZR25X0CNOJX,Works great!,"I enjoy photography as a hobby mainly- as a way of recording my family's life events for fun.I didn't want to have to spend a lot on a zoom lens for my Canon DSLR.This lens fit my camera just fine.  It's not an expensive lens to begin with, so it wasn't very quick with the ""auto-focus.""  I was also new to using the ""action"" setting, which takes 3 to 4 frames per second when you hold down the shutter button.  So while several of my shots were slightly blurry, I did notice that it did a good job trying to ""follow"" the subject.I was shooting a basketball game, and trying to focus on one player in particular.  When I would slightly depress the shutter, I noticed that a rectangle would show up around my subject, and follow him as long as he was in the ""frame.""  That was pretty cool.  It sort of ""knew"" who I was trying to focus on. Several shots came out well.  I need more practice.A 300mm zoom isn't tremendous, but it does make things a few times larger than ""naked eye"" size.I was pleased with the automatic exposure.Don't try to focus on anything closer than 5 feet when using this lens.Overall, I was very pleased with this lens!"
A59EGCJV0IHSS,The Camera You Can't Outgrow.,"The Nikon 990 was my first digital camera, and after eighteen months of use, I don't regret my decision to pick it at all.I chose it because ofits high pixel count (3.34 Mpixels, which make for large images that can print 8X10 and be indistinguishable from a 35mm print);its multi-functionality (point and shoot automatic-everything, aperture preferred, shutter preferred, and even completely manual modes);its popularity (which means that there're TONS of aftermarket lenses, etc. for it); andits ease of use (I'm sold on the rotating body).I've never regretted it.There're warts to the 990, of course; no camera's perfect.  The built-in speedlight right next to the lens guarantees harsh lighting, big shadows, and red-eye (the 995 isn't much better); and the fact that a thousand-dollar camera doesn't come with a hot shoe is scandalous.But the options are there, not only from Nikon but places like EagleEye; and the number of CoolPix 990 user groups on the Internet guarantee a large group of friends you can call on for help.Once you get through the menu learning curve, the ease of use and quality of the image simply can't be beat.  I simply can't imagine a better camera for the money."
A10K41QA6YVOXR,not impressed,"Sub standard cables, not the Belkin quality I have come to expect. It took almost 3 weeks to get them, and now that I have tried both of the cables I am not impressed with the quality of the product or the shipper. A consistent connection is iffy at best, not like the other cables that I currently have, so the problem is not with my system it is with the cables. When I finally received them, the plastic package had yellowed. So these units were either old or had been exposed to sunlight for a long period of time. Save your time and money, order them from somebody else."
A21SVYWKXQUE40,Exercise caution,"I purchased this type of CDRW and had problems from the start.  The store I purchased it from refused to accept it back unless the manufacturer provided proof it was defective.When I contacted the Philips Tech group, all I received was automated messages about how to install the device and a number to call if that didn't work.  When I called the number, they told me my operating system was defective.  When I installed a different operating system and the CDRW still didn't work, they told me it was my computer.  when I replaced my computer, they told me the warranty was over.  When I went to look for technical data on the CDRW, the Philips USA website was unable to locate the CDRW type PCRW804K17 or even PCRW804.  I would recommend trying a product from a different company.  My CDRW does make a moderately good placeholder for an empty computer bay."
AC5YSZKDJ2YGE,Sound at a great price!,"This sound card Is really awesome. It comes with Accelerates Microsoft DirectSound3D, EAX, and A3D at a great price. With Creatives new EAX sound it makes any game more injoyable. With A3D you can hear the difference when  playing games or music in stero sound. Plus you can hook up 4 speakers to  it which is great for those who like to play games. It is also has great  price for all you get."
A25C1PGDWZ5G3V,Now what did I do with this camera,I think I ended up selling this camera on eBay for parts. The button on top broke and I think It had some type of error. Overall it was a great little camera that fit right into your pocket.
AJ8DQHNP0FFWF,Wonderful Gift for Computer-phobic relatives/friends,"After switching to digital photos, it had become a problem to get new pix to computer-phobic relatives and friends, who couldn't or wouldn't open e-mails, visit web-photo-sites, etc. I've bought two of 'em, and everything was easy, flawless to set up and use. You can even set up guest 'updaters' so multiple people (e.g., siblings) can update the frame with competing grandkid photos. I would get a non-networked frame for around my own house, but for remote access and update, esp. for non-computer people, this is a great and high quality product."
AO2FXIAM4EKOS,Get the Wet Tape Cleaner,This is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better. Simple to use and can be used multiple times.
ATK6UK8JFYQIS,Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro lens,"I bought this as a gift for my husband.  I know absolutely nothing about macro lenses.  I wasn't sure that it would be the right one.  But, he absolutely loves it.  I also saved $200 over buying it in a local store."
A3VHX9D0GXB7BT,very good miniDv Digital Video Camcorder,"very good miniDv Digital Video Camcorder in that price range (...). The unit is very light 1.3lb. Outdoor video is pretty good, but indoor isn't. Included battery is only for 30 minutes recoeding with LCD on. Remote control in very ugly, AC adaptor/charger and other accessaries are very rough, not Japan-made, the unit is just fine. Not 0 Lux, so video is terrible in weak light, the build-in light is useless at all in this case. I did not try still image mode, 640x480 VGA is not good enough for printing. Include software is for Win95/98 only, not for NT/2000. The indoor recording video is ""red"", you need to calabriate to write-balance to reduce this ugly effect. Summary: it is good enough for home use, but video and audio quality is just fair."
A1XHUM73HKZQZW,Buy the Canon 250D & don't waste your time with cheap closeup lens,"After struggling with all the abberations(chromatic & flare) from using a cheap set of closeup filters,i investigated & found the Canon 250D 4X closeup diopter. Although relatively pricey, i swallowed hard & ordered the Canon 250D from Amazon. When it arrived i put it on my Sony DSC-H2's lens adapter & discovered a revelation; the quality of the Canon 250D's 2 lens elements eliminated all the chromatic abberations & flare artifacts that were present when using cheap closeup filters. Now instead of fighting my composition for a closeup & spending time trying to edit out all the abberations i was getting great closeup images. This closeup lens can be used with any 58mm threaded lens. I have even used it on other larger thread lens with a step down adapter, you just need to be aware of possible vignetting."
A27K0YP1K31PVV,Fits the A610,"I bought this for my Canon Powershot A610 because canon's case which was made for this model (dcc-300) hasn't been released in the U.S. as far as I can tell, and I didn't want to squeeze it into the model made for the A95.As for the case, it fits very nicely. The space for the extra memory card is good. The lining is excellent. The batteries are supposed to go to the side of the camera, not in front, and though fitting four AAs is a bit tricky, it can be done, and that way no batteries fall out when the case is opened."
A3HFPT5BGLXPCJ,Terrible.,"This flash drive is terrible. After about a month of use and I put all of my pictures onto it, it decided not to work....I lost all of my pictures. One of the worst things that could happen. Do not buy."
ASSL6QHLNQ8DC,"Great Product , But ???","Love the product, but a little disapointed in finding out bothlens are different mm, one is 55mm the other is 49mm.how is a person to use filters interchangably between the two?wish they both would have been 55mm"
A2988T61PQY6DN,Nice Printer Cable,I needed a longer printer cord in my home office. This works just fine with my HP printer connected to my computer.
A154Q8G3EXQ0Y0,BUYER BEWARE,"I am one of those saps who tries to see the positive in anything.  I bend over backwards to give credit when someone gives an honest effort, to give the benefit of doubt when things don't go as one may expect.  With this said, my experience with Barnes and Noble has been a nightmare.  I have spent THREE HOURS on the phone trying to resolve a $6.45 charge that was improperly charged to my account as confirmed by a CS representative and her supervisor!!!!  B&N;'s solution - the supervisor sent emails to 3 departments.  Why?  Because ""they can be busy"" and so by sending an email to 3 departments she was hopeful that one department might respond soon.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  My resolution to the problem?  To remove my credit card information from B&N; so it could no longer arbitrarily post charges against my credit cardMy experience with B&N; began 3 months ago.  I was given a Nook Color as a ""gift"" and truth be told, wish I hadn't.  At first I was excited.  For YEARS, I have accessed and downloaded ebooks from my local library with little effort.  With the Nook, I imagined that I would be able to download books to a portable format.  Alas, this is not the case!  Admittedly, it can be done, but not without a lot of effort.  If I owned, however, an iPad or Kindle, I would be able to download an ebook within moments.  Within the first few days of owning the Nook, it became apparent that unless I was willing to buy a book through B&N; I would pay dearly (in terms of hours of time on my laptop and internet) trying to download otherwise ""free"" ebooks.  And dealing with B&N;'s customer ""service"" is nothing short of a nightmare.  This is not a retailer or product  that I would recommend to anyone.  And although I work 4 blocks from a B&N; store, I would rather drive across town or get online and order from Amazon than deal with B&N.;  Why?  Because when there's a problem, I know Amazon and other local retailers WILL provide customer ""service"".  And I KNOW, Barnes and Noble will not."
A16F2NQWALS7SQ,Philips MX980D is Excellent,"I bought the 980D and loved the larger than most sized speakers that came with it.  The 100 watts per channel was comparable to systems going up to 1000 dollars.  The main thing is the sound, which is excellent."
AE9213DUJ9M5J,CDs would not work on other players,"I purchased this machine &quot;elsewhere&quot;.  It made CDs easily, but when I tried to play them on any other player, it would not work (yes, duh, they were CDRs not CDRWs).  I took the machine back to the store for a  refund and can't find any other price-comparable machine."
AB55I2G2CFZD5,Great round graduated filter for the price,"I use this filter with my Nikon kit lenses.  Works very well, but you by design, it is less graduated with the lens zoomed in.  I take it with me  every time I shoot outdoors and use it as often as my polarizer.  I just keep it in the case that it came in, but if that ever breaks I will need to find a good filter case to protect this beauty because I do plan on keeping it :)"
A2DGGVUKUG5ZMU,A Stylish product,If there is anything remarkable about the Visor Deluxe then it is the look which draws you to it. In terms of functionality it has a few more features than the Palm IIIxe. Of course the expansion slot makes it an innovative product. These modules don't come cheap. I was upset about the 8MB DRAM  issue until i saw the update posted on Handspring's website which corrects  the fault. ...
A13DRF1OOL6BCO,Bevana's review,"Nice bag, haven't received the camera yet to put into it, but I think it will work fine."
A1WRIZ1XUOG05T,Best $12 bucks you'll spend,"This is my 2nd Tiffen filter. I bought one for my $850 Nikon lens and recently dropped my camera while in the case. The Tiffen filter shattered, but broke the fall and my Nikon lens is totally intact. I just bought another to keep my precious camera safe!"
A80SFDVGOCBU8,It worked,"My last Heath/Zenith sensor on newly installed light lasted about 2 years. I thought I would have to buy the whole unit, but glad they sell just the sensor.Box said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch, but I didn't. I don't understand why that was needed.The original sensor came with a green ground wire...this sensor does not. Not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anyway.This sensor turns the light on Full bright RIGHT NOW. My original sensor ramped up the light over a second or two.No directions, so just pay attention...white to white, black to black and red to red. Pretty strait forward."
AAHBKSL268U2L,Sturdy little blower!,"So I bought this blower with every intention of using it in my computer, but I ended up installing it in a homemade incubator made from a refrigerator. I clipped the plug and wired it to a 12v wall wart, and stuck it near the light at the top of the incubator (to draw the heat from the top and blow it downward creating a more even overall temperature). This little beast has been running nonstop for almost 6 months at 99.5F and at humidity levels up to 80%. It's nearly silent, which is nice for the chicks. Even though the heat isn't as extreme as the inside of a PC, the fact that it can stand up to that type of humidity, and nonstop use is impressive in my book. I highly recommend this blower for it's hardiness."
A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,Excellent but not as easy as they say,"I had it open and up and running and all my computers going on my 100MB DSL speed and was so happy.  Okay, it is easy to set up, BUT...then came the problem.  I run several MSN groups and suddenly I could not post messages!  Okay, I concede maybe not everyone expects to post at MSN groups, but.....Then WHOA NELLY - I went to Microsoft Windows Update Window and I could not access it.  It could not scan my computer.  Now wait a bloody minute!!!!!!!  Not being able to post in the MSN Groups is one thing, NOT being able to update your computer with Microsoft patches is Suicide!  I mean nearly EVERYONE needs to access Microsoft update window to keep their computer safe from all the wholes in XP!!!  THis is BAD OVERSITE.So I emailed them.  I got a quick response that I had to go and set up port forwarding yadayada....EXCUSE ME...suddenly the easy set up was NO SO EASY as promised.Yes, it is very good, yes it gives four computers 100MB speed at one and I am so thrilled.  However, this BIG OVERSITE of not being able to access Microsoft is ridiculous.  Yes, it can been fixed by changing the ports for forward microsoft traffic - but the point is WHY SHOULD THEY????  One of the most basic things we need to access Windows Update and you cannot unless you make changes.Those changes SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE before the first one of this was shipping.Shame on them for making customers work, shame on them for not being as easy as they promised, and shame on them for ignoring nearly everyone will have to go through this and NOT GIVE any warning!!Four Stars for the product, four stars for their promt response - ONE STAR for their stupid plans on not including something every computer would need to access.  If your computers are newer you will likely want to go wireless instead."
A2622K4C2NMUW5,Do not buy B&N ebooks!,Two points only:1) The ereader device is wonderful2) DO NOT purchase ebooks from B&N; as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult / not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.  This is not true for ebook stores such as the Sony ebook store.
AXTEKFAQYLK2Q,P.O.S.,"I bought this watch with the HR monitor addition. I'm in the Army and I thought this watch would be a great asset to have with me on the Medevac. I couldn't be more wrong than if I went into war with empty mags. The heart rate sensor worked only once and that was indoors with no sweat involved. The day I got it was the last day it ever worked. The compass, now that's an issue that that is unacceptable. It constantly quit regestering after walking only 10 feet. I was trying to be patient and give the piece of junk a minute to get it's bearing. It did, I think, I didn't have a second compass to verify at the moment in my yard. I walked a few feet in a strait line and once again it went blank. I'm too pissed off at this point to even consider trying any of the other functions. I now have a 400 dollar stopwatch that might be able to tell me if I'm running up hill or down, who knows.That lens protector that they offer, and yes I bought it to ""protect my so-called do-it-all watch"", is the dumbest crap I have ever seen. It's a 1/4"" thick piece of clear silicone that sets on top of the display. It's hard to see the data being displayed on a good day when it is dry and clean. Everything can get under it and cause more damage to the crystal and makes it impossible to read anything on the watch.I have to say I'm sorry that I bought into the hype and listened to my fellow soldiers who are also starting to have the same issues with their Sunto's as well. Finland, you should be ashamed to have your name on this klind of performance."
A2PTIKVWVDB3LV,Works flawlessly,"This wireless router was very simple to configure, the instructions were great and I did not even have to re-configure it after re-formatting my hard drive.  I have had zero issues over the past 12 months even after multiple power failures (hurricanes and other acts of God) and two weeks of being disconnected when I was on vacation.  You can use it wirelessly or use cable connections for 4 additional ethernet devices.  It obviously is more cost effective to purchase a router for multiple ethernet connections than to have to pay your cable company for additional connections.  I use it to access my company's secure network from home and the difference in performance between connecting from home or connecting at work is negligible."
A1OQJBYMMBRC6C,false advertising,"This chord is really about half the length they claim. The coiled part is impossible to fully extend, but the only way this chord would be the length they claimed would be if you could uncoil this. Also because it has a huge coiled up part in the middle the chord is very heavy. If you do not place something on top of it to secure it you may find the chord's weight pulling your ear plugs from your ears.It does work fine however, just be aware the length is much shorter then they claim, and the chord is heavy."
A3NOTYEKPAKWV6,Glad I got this mouse-in-a-box out of the box!!!,"I received this for a Christmas present from my Son.  Best gift I have received since he got me my computer.  I want to talk about the service I have received:  My first mouse had a little problem, I called Kensington Customer Service.  They were just wonderful!  In two days I had a new mouse and it is working wonderful!!!!  I recommend this product highly, not only for the exceptional quality, but also for their customer service.  Very helpful and understanding."
AFH0V9CYF56IK,Great Battery,"I bought two of these batteries with the Overnight Nimh Family Battery Charger, and so far the batteries have performed as expected. haven't used it enough to see if they take memory if charged to frequently but so far so good. Great product!So now I have used this product for 5 months on a Microphone to line amplifyer and they last about 2 days on average.  The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous! luckly I only use one at a time so I have time to charge the other one.I would still say Great Product!"
A8XZ57HSJ107W,Nice!,"It is a nice case. It allows you to read the whole unit screen, while also adding some protection."
A244D78IJ9XM7Z,NOt what was pictured,The picture that came wiht the add on Amazon showed removable pages but the actual item only had fixed sheets. I kept it but am not 100% satisfied
A1JBMZRN6M3NKC,"Works as intended as far as I know, a longer cable would be nice",I guess there's no way to negatively rate it's performance unless it doesn't prevent ESD... but I've read that these don't guarantee that and that's a normal thing with them. Anyway it was comfortable and easy to use but I would have preferred a longer cable.
A1JRLITJT3W1WR,better than a 2nd phone line,"Works great.  Took a while to get everything set up to work smoothly, but it's a lot cheaper than paying for a 2nd phone line every single month.  Make sure you read the instructions thoroughly, and you have to set your fax machine to answer in one ring, or it won't work.  Still working out some kinks, like when I have a phone message on my answering machine, incoming calls answer too quickly, and then the fax can't pick it up. I'm sure I'll get it all worked out eventually, but 99% of the time, this switch works perfectly."
AJ0ZI195JL3JY,Great sound and Comfort but not Durable,"I've had too many pairs of these to count because they break so easily. The sound quality and comfort is the best on the market for this price, but you get what you pay for. These do not last."
A6STM7C6I8OLL,Works precisely as expected,"While slightly dated (no gigabit support) the unit is small enough to fit within our entertainment center, has ample ports, and as I said, works as intended. Recommended."
A2JK496YI51NMV,Surprisingly good and great value,"My 4 year old has started adding and subtracting.  Even though the game sounded too simple and boring, I figured for ten bucks it was worth a try so I bought it.  It was the Christmas gift that got the most use over the break!  He loves it and it gives him a lot of practice with his math.  Surprisingly, I don't mind playing it with him! (especially since most of the time he will do the math and move my piece for me).  Now if I can only get him not to cheat..."
A3K2E2C5Q0TVNC,this is the best!,you know i was looking for a good cd player lately  and i saw this one i heard of koss before and its great!  you should buy one two it doesn't skip and it is basically great.
A2O5CDFIMNYNNB,just got it,Just picked up my oly yesterday and already have taken about a dozen pics and emailed some and reprinted some. I am a true novice when it comes to cameras so for me to get that far that soon is saying something about this user friendly camera.I also bought the smart media writer which is really  cool. Rechargable batteries are a must. Happy so far.
A11AR0AIE8DWUU,What every compact camera needs,A handy camera bag for small digital cameras. Protects the not only the camera but also the recharge adaptor. Worth the money spent.
A9GIGJUB98JNR,"possibly unhealthy, sounds weak, won't last long","I don't use earbuds much, so store these away most of the time.  Imagine my surprise, when I needed earbuds during Hurricane Ike for my radio, and found the foam on these had corroded.  Can you imagine the foam in your ear canal?Didn't sound that good to begin with."
A2YFH12V7BVBZ9,Kodak Film,"This film didn't work very well for me. I put it in my Canon Rebel 35mm camera and took it to a horse show. It was a semi-cloudy day which I thought would be great for photos, but they came out light and faded-looking. It might have been my camera, but other photos (400) I have taken with it turned out just fine."
A22GTND0XPR5BJ,WORTH EVERY PENNY !,"I just recently bought this digital camera for our real estate business...I was comparing this model with a comperable Sony model....after viewing the specs...NO QUESTION THIS WAS THE ONE ! ...a ton of software, and accessories that were included for this price..you have it all.. The over 2,000,000 pixels it has in High Resolution...one word WOW ! and it is so easy to use with the software and the USB port.. I would HIGHLY reccommend this digital camera to everyone..worth the PRICE--VALUE and everything it has to offer."
A16F3IAR2659FN,"Excellent, durable headphones","I first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version, the MDR-7506, for more than 10 years as a professional field video producer. I bought the MDR-V600's for home use, and they look and sound new after 11 years of occasional use at home.These are an over-the-ear headphone, meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears, which means that your ears don't get sore. This also acoustically isolates you from your environment.  However, if you sweat heavily, they also tend to trap moisture.Sound reproduction is excellent and full-range, and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones, you will hear well and you won't hear much of what's going on around you outside the phones. They do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies, but that's something that most people don't mind.The screw-on 1/4"" tip screws off to reveal a 1/8"" stereo plug, so the phones work with most playback devices. I highly recommend them as durable, acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years."
ACX89C5DVWDJJ,Great lil camera!,"this is awesome, cheap, portable pics at anytime. got one myself 2 months ago.  this is cool! must have if you own pets and like to have lots of pics."
A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,Caveat emptor!,"I purchased this system for my father, as a father's day gift.  It arrived [...]in a timely fashion, as always, but then I waited and waited and waited for DirecTV to get in touch with me for installation (as indicated in the information provided on this page.)  When I finally got tired of waiting, I called them, figuring it was some sort of glitch.  What I got was a rude, arrogant, don't-know-nothing-don't-want-to-know-nothing attitude from the customer service person I spoke to who assured me that they did NOT provide installation.  That was something I had to get from the place that sold it to me.  And no matter how many times I tried to explain, the response was always, ""No, you have to contact the place where you bought it.  This isn't our problem.""Well I did contact the place where I bought it to tell them to take it back because I was not about to take this any further.  And to Amazon's eternal credit, they took it back, no questions asked, and apologized for the problem.  In my opinion, they had nothing to apologize for; they did what they were supposed to do.  It's DirecTV that fell down on the job.  So ask yourself (as I did) do you want to be tied to a company that has such a loose definition of service?  The prospect of months or even years - assuming they ever bothered to hook up the system; I have a friend who is still waiting nearly 10 months after recieving a system as a Christmas gift - of trying to get them to respond in case of problems, was just daunting.  So I called DISH, they hooked up a system within 3 days and have always been polite and helpful when there have been problems or requests on this end.  HUGE difference, and one I recommend you take into account before you commit to something like this."
A7JR9LZTJT3N2,The best camera for the bucks!!,"The Canon XL1 is an amazing camera to shoot with. The picture quality is awesome and the audio is sweet. The camera is sleek and professional looking, people take you serious when you go out on a shoot with the ""Big Boys."" You get the same respect! If I had to buy another camera it would be the Canon XL!!"
A23TM175MUFKBB,Didn't receive what I ordered,"First off, this vendor apparently doesn't ship the product they advertise. While the product description clearly shows Fuji HQ, what I got was just plain old Fujicolor; not the same film at all. That kinda sucks. And from reading other reviews here, that seems to be the way they roll.Now, to keep things in perspective, it's not the end of the world. Rather than go through the hassle of returning the film (which after all was only about $8), I'm going to try it out. How bad could it be? I know Fuji makes good film in general. And the other good thing was that the film was well within its expiration date (my film was dated 2014, plenty of time to go), unlike some vendors who ship outdated film.But really, guys, if you show HQ, you ought to ship HQ, or change your description to match what you actually send. Otherwise, this is a deceptive sales practice. I know HQ is good, since I used it for years: it remains to be seen if Fujicolor measure up or not."
A147YIUC72X6F,"As comfortable as the original, with more freedom!","I have been using the trackman marble forever - it came out, then was discontinued (in favor of other shapes and other ball positions) and was then brought back again. I've bought a few over the years, but the older ones are still being used by my kids - they stick around.This latest one is wireless, with the same shape and feel - no adjustment period. The range isn't bad, but if I bring it all the way into my lap (with the sensor at the back of the desk) it gets skippy.Overall, I love it - highly recommended. Just note that the sensor thingy (dongle) is big. It's not a tiny thing, but a wire and something sort of mouse-sized on the end."
ARQHICZNCC2YW,Took Great! photos for the Price.,This lens took great! photos for the money you paid for.  this is an above average lens.  If you have money get the L class lens.
AW4F3021G0RUG,Why 5 when the world says 4?,"The Kodak DX 3500 was rated at four stars. I find mine to be FIVE STARS. It would be interesting to know if the other owners have the Camera Dock. Yes, it's [expensive] but what a breeze to use. Pop the camera into the docking station and push the button and your pictures are loaded into your computer. Also, if you are using rechargeable cells the docking station will keep them fully charged. A full charge from dead flat in 2.5 hours. The camera itself is a delight to use. I never used one before and had mine up and running with the supplied software loaded and the first three test pictures (of my cat) on the monitor screen in about 1/2 hour. This little camera does more then my 35mm SLR and I see instant results. If I do not like the picture for what ever reason (camera angle, subject movement, etc.) I can delete the shot and retake it. In about 3 minutes I have written a letter with a picture attached and sent to my children and grandchildren living 300 miles away. They share our lives as we live it, not as an afterthought three weeks later when the film is developed, we pick out the pictures we want to send, and then ""snail-mail"" the pictures to them. I don't know why I waited so long to buy a digital camera and this Kodak DX 3500 fits the bill."
A6ZEPK6Q2V7OE,Hard Time Returning,"I purchased this as a gift. When I recevied the package, it was damaged. Both the box it came in as well as the Nook itself. I submitted a request for a return, but instead of anyone from the end seller contacting me, they simply sent me another Nook. I didn't ask for an exchange - I wanted a refund since I already replaced the gift. I ended up having to ship the second Nook back (paying for it myself, by the way) and had numerous phone calls with customer services. Everything else I've purchased through Amazon has been great - my problem is with the end seller!"
A20BY7D3YLLC0V,excellent headphones,"I researched for quite a while, and was sold on the high number of very positive reviews. I'm very happy with the quality of construction and especially the sound. An excellent purchase for the price."
A3GZMLPY0L9YXC,A snap to use and fits the need!,This USB to prallel cable fit the need perfectly and was a snap to use. Allowed the continued use of a workhorse HP LaserJet 6MP with Windows 7 on a new system.
A2ZGSHBH47H9KL,wish i read reviews before buying,"I was very excited to receive my jensen remote control.  It was pretty easy to program, nice backlighting. But could not get it to work with my denon avr900, which rendered it useless to me. So sad, I sent it back to  amazon, which very kindly paid the shipping.  I am still looking for a good  remote for around the same price. The search continues....."
AN30G4IKL1BMZ,"Great sound quality, highly recommended","I was super happy when I first received these headphones.  The quality of the construction is great!  For the price of the headphones, you are getting a steal!It comes with a 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; adapter, and all contacts are gold-plated.  The headphones can fold in for easier storage, and the cable is super long, just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system).I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones, and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality."
A3HRDRQ5VAFPQS,"Excellent quality, good results.","I've enjoyed using this Tiffen filter - it's a basic filter, and does what it's supposed to do without problems or hassles."
A1QO5V2C81GKQN,Tougher Than the Cameras,"I bought this case to protect my first digital camera. I would never have expected to go through three cameras and continue using the same case with the fourth. Just enough room to hold a camera, extra memory and batteries. You can't beat it."
A342ZILZJ260ST,Best cheap headphones you can buy,"Love these headphones.  I have several of them.  Works with my computer, my cd players, even works with my cell phone except it does not have an answer button.  The sound is very good considering the price you pay, and they are lightweight and comfortable.  Even gave one to my husband to use with his portable ham radio."
A1GOA7ECL05LYC,Very Fast,"With USB, the hotsyncing with programs like Avant Go, are very speedy. Now you can sync on two computers with this extra cradle."
A31UZS1UKXVTE,An engineering marvel,"Wow.I bought my Visor Platinum and Targus Stowaway on the same day, and at this point, I couldn't imagine one without the other.  Aside from its utterly cool engineering, the Stowaway makes word processing not only possible but easy on my Visor.  When folded, it's light but feels solid.  The full-size keys are a must, of course, and the keyboard has a nice feel, with good key response.Cons: Eats batteries for lunch, compared with non-keyboard use; also, the docking port is a little difficult to use and looks (though it really isn't) kind of flimsy."
A2QSGQAWZ11J2,"Excellent for owner, but don't let anyone else operate it","I bought this camera the first part of 1998.  I have used it regularly for more than 5 years, and I have NEVER had any kind of problem with it.  All the features work great and none of the parts have malfunctioned.  The camera is great if you're the owner and you know how it works.  However, my one qualm is that almost every time I have given the camera to someone else to take a photo of me, they have seriously screwed up the photo.  Almost everyone is confused with the zoom and the actual &quot;take the picture button.&quot;  It seems obvious to me, but for the average random snapshot-taker, it's confusing.  When red eye reduction is on, there is quite a bit of time between pushing the button and taking the picture.  Time and time again I will hand off the camera, the person will push the button, and because it doesn't take immediately, they move the camera.  I have so many blurry shots of half people and sides of rooms.  As a result, I have become a huge fan of self timer photos.  But you can't blame that on the camera.Summary:  This camera won't give you problems and will take beautiful pictures.  But if you plan to hand it off so you can get photos of you, be careful who you hand it to, or avoid using the red eye reduction feature."
AT8IVMD8NVVO8,Jam Cam,This was a great little camera for its day.  I think it has been overcome by technology now.  It did take some good pictures.
A1UWKOQA703TL9,Poor Palm QC drove me away,"This product, while useful, is a lemon. I've owned 3 Palms (M105, IIIxE, and this m500) and have had problems with each of them. I had to send my 105 back; used the replacement for a while until I got the 3xE, had to send that back after about 6 months; after it completely broke, I went to the m500. My first one worked fine for almost 8 months, then died. I sent it back, and the replacement died after three months. The replacement I have now (#3) requires a soft reset almost every time I hot synch, and will often reset itself as soon as I remove it from the cradle. I'll be sending it back, and E-baying the replacement, as I have just bought a new Ipaq.Palm's lousy quality control drove me away from a very nice product-- but I won't trust them again. No more Palms for me."
A2IAXKTT5LW5DK,Maxell 203020,This item was a lifesaver since I have an analog camera and can't find cassettes anywhere any more and have to film a movie. Thanks.
A1NXZFIFACAU09,Spinning my wheels,"Bought this unit to hold a 100' 12/3 extension cord I use for my electric snow blower.  It went together and mounted on the wall easy enough but the handle with the wheel doesn't grip the cord.  I am left turning the crank with no movement to the cord.  It appears that the wheel is not ""grippy"" enough to pull the cord into the basket.  Nice try, but it doesn't work for me."
A2UVMLQQ0BRACM,wonderful product,"if you're looking a product resistant, practical and price affordable this is it.Has all the functions that you require specially if you're a skydiver."
A2BG7OXEQXYWIG,Casio TV 880 is a great buy!!!,"The reception of this TV is great. I am using this TV outside the US and it is ideal for camping,touring or sight seeing. Awesome product and portability!"
A3PGVFP9FOQH8N,Great piece of kit,"Despite paying nearly double the current price because I bought it when it first came out, I still feel I've had excellent value. It's an easy to use, fast, enjoyable piece of kit. Fuji after sales service is also excellent (refreshingly so). I bought a larger memory card (128meg) giving me the capacity for 700 good quality snaps - fantastic on a long holiday. Download time is virtually instant with the USB cable. If I were buying now, I'd look at Fuji's other models first, but you cant go wrong with this one. The only niggle I can think of is that the zoom isnt great. Enjoy."
A2ZLMC7JW43G1L,E-Bookman/ Great purchase!!,I found just what I was looking for ay a great price! My purchase came quickly and I am very pleased with my Franklin E-Bookman! Now I can take my ebooks wherever I go! I love it!
ARHBFC07LPMFO,"Sturdy, well-cushioned camera bag","This bag is advertised as having capacity for two camera bodies and two lenses.  That is true if you dismantle both cameras every time.  However, it works very well for a camera with a standard-length lens without having to take it apart, with extra room for small items in front pocket and memory cards in an inside mesh pocket."
A1PTD8UH2T3VYM,"Good all around, but lacks some features","I just bought one of these without the benefit of actually having seen it plugged into a TV. (after buying an Apex model that I loved except for the fact that it broke down after an hour of use!) The panasonic works well for DVDs, although it lacks some of the wizardry of the Apex unit (for example, the ability to zoom the picture). But I think most &quot;mainstream&quot; players are behind on things like this, at least those in the lower-end of the market.The system plays MP3s well in terms of audio, but be warned -- it doesn't seem to have a user interface for MP3 or CD playback. When I put a CD-R with a number of MP3s in folders in, it played it as if it were a CD, one track after another with no screen display. This means it's great if you have a lot of songs and just want to play them one after another, but not good if you want to be able to select songs arbitrarily.I was also disappointed by the lack of video in jacks on the unit. Instead, the system requires that you route all video directly to the TV, and then use the audio out jacks on the TV to feed to the DVD/home theater. This got pretty complicated in my situation. (TV,VCR,Cassette Deck,Digital Cable Box, and the HT70.)  Basically the only way I could make it work use the s-video port on the TV for the dvd player, and use the RCA video port for the VCR, which unfortunately requires using a menu on the TV to switch between the inputs. Would be simpler if my TV had more aux video ports, but it would be nicer if the home theater unit could act as a central hub for all other components.(Am also frustrated by the fact that I now have three remotes that all claim to be &quot;universal,&quot; yet am finding no matter how much twiddling I do with them, I still need all three to actually manipulate the entertainment system! But Panasonic only gets 1/3 of the blame on that one.)Overall, I think the unit is probably a pretty good bet if you want a simple box that is competent at many things. But if you're looking for fancy features, this may not be the best choice.-David Dwiggins"
A3T6W3UKZBIUTB,Good but not great,Not sure why so many 5 star reviews. They work okay. For the price I'd buy them again ($3) no question. They are cheap headphones that you'd expect to get with an old Walkman or hand held CD player.
A3MKD715F5HG9C,This is the coolest gadget on the Planet!!!,"Can't say enought about the Ipaq.  I've had it for just over a week and already I'm reading Ebooks, Surfing the web and Wireless at work.  It a do-it-all/have-it-all system.  remember, its not a PDA!, its a true POCKET PC!!!  You Gotta get it to believe it."
A18J9QR0I6P3DF,Great for its price,"The headphones sound great and the microphone works pretty well.  The headphone adjust mechanism will sometimes catch onto hair and the volume control is nonintuitive(turn wheel down to increase volume), but these are minor issues.  Another temporary problem is the slightly nauseating plastic smell that comes with the new product.  I expect that it will fade over time.  Overall, very pleased."
A24OUY0DIAT1,a great dv camcorder,"I've owned the ultura since late January and so far have been completely satisfied with it.. is has a great range of features and turns out incredible quality footage. I also bought a DV Capture card for my  computer, and the ultura allows for easy editing of videos.  The digital  zoom works up to about 64x, and some of the &quot;modes&quot; are not very  useful, but all around, it's great!"
A373R2TBXL3Y79,Dull but still useable.,"It does its job, just as it did 20 years ago. Hi-Fi it is not, but it records and plays back ordinary audio matters. Its cheap drawback is that it cannot connect easily via USB or any other computer useable signal.  Low-Tech but still portable and functioning in our outdoor and primitive venues."
ARQM92ZO4KS4B,Only for newbies,This is a very easy to use camera ideally suited for newcomers to digital photography. This is probably the cheapest 2.1 megapixel camera in the market at the moment. But be prepared to compromise on quality. Pictures are of acceptable quality in good daylight but absolutely horrible in low lit surroundings. The auto focus doesnt work that well either.I returned mine after two weeks. My recommendation: Go get a Canaon A20 instead.
A2YW51OBVLHQNE,Great products,"Great Quality, holds a lot of Cds just what we needed - sleeves are pretty sturdy that hold the Cds in place"
A3N8OOCWPX0DIU,It worked as advertised,"It feels weird giving a rating to something like this, but it worked when I plugged it in and I have had no problems with it.What can I say? 5 stars"
A3KKVPRYPR0JBG,Pretty bad...,"I tried out this kvm switch and didn't like it much at all. First off my computers think I'm using a different mouse with it (linux didn't like it at all). Second the mouse lagged a bit. Getting to worse things, the control key is really lagged with this switch, not good for games that use the control key. If you press the control key repeatedly then you get switched to the other computer. Finally, the worst thing is, don't expect to play any high throughput graphics games on this thing. I tried playing quake3 on it and it looked like utter crap, made my geforce 2 card look like a voodoo1 (or perhaps worse). Other than that, it was ok for basic stuff, just not for me."
A2CJWKV6I6J9OZ,Not bad...,"Well it is winter and static is common place, this little ASWB has done it job so far. I am almost tempted to put this on even while filling gas. No fried GPU or blown cars :)"
A2YYU3DF39CTTB,Spacious Photo Backpack is a Good Buy!,"The Tamrac &quot;5275 Expedition 5 Photo Backpack&quot; was a valuable find for me.The backpack provides enough room for my 2 cameras,6 lenses,and other accessories.The backpack has alot of padding and also has movable pads inside to adjust to the amount of equipment you have.The 1 thing I really didnt like was that the movable pads inside the backpack are relatively hard to adjust.If You like taking all your equipment with You on camping trips,hikes,and other outdoor activities;I would recommend this product to You."
AV5LGDYISOC1I,"Great Value, Easy to Install","The installation was so easy - just plug the transmitter in, add batteries to the speaker, turn the speaker on and you are good to go. The sound quality is fine and two speakers will work from just one transmitter or independently from each transmitter. A great value for the money."
A3VV3WW4Y3NSXH,A boon for self-portrait & group shots!,"This is the second RM-1 remote control that I have.  The first one came with my C-2020Z camera and served  me well.  I used it to take some 2000 pics.  In the  interim, I also threw in lots of abuse for good measure  |-) :  I dropped it numerous times, stepped on it, etc.When it finally conked out, the original battery was  still going strong.  Battery power consumption had not  been an issue.The remote control is great for taking self-portrait,  or for group shots.  It's *much* better than using the  self-timer: no need to run & get into position after  tripping the timer!The only problem that I experienced was when using it  outdoors, its range is somewhat limited.  Once when I  needed to take a pic of a group of people posing next  to their cars (i.e. a pic where the camera needs to be  a bit of a way away), I needed to walk up closer to  the camera (on a tripod) before the remote control  would work.-- Andy Nguyen \ aqn at panix dot com"
A3V0W3FHKL6468,Made my bedroom a theater,Amazing! Exceeded my expectations! It fits snuggly up against my wall then swings out over the foot of my bed. It tilts left and right and swivels up or down as well as swings into various positions. Better than I hoped or envisioned!
A8LF0KG1JHP83,A Great Hiking Companion,"For hikers and Geocachers looking for a low cost GPS unit, this is the one for you. I purchased the eTrex Legend after a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did.Used on some long hikes, the unit tracks routes well and creating waypoints is very user friendly when compared with other hand helds. Slight signal loss during heavy tree cover but nothing I wouldn't expect from a low cost product.If you have money to burn, then investing in a more robust unit maybe the way to go for die-hard gadget fans. But if you are shopping on a budget, this device will be plenty for what you need. I won't hike without it."
AJ3XLPL6AJFP5,Great while it was needed,Wroked great - still does and I don't need it nay longer. If you need a dock for you Palm this is the one.
A80VQ9L3D0A8K,a flimsy half-case,"I was disappointed to see that this ""case"" is really just a shell that clicks on the back of the phone- it does nothing to protect any part of the face of the phone or front edges. In addition, it quickly developed a slight twist so that it doesn't fit tightly. I am only keeping it on the phone long enough to get a better case. I like slim hard shell cases, but this was not what I was hoping for. I'll need to get something more substantial."
A168A6ZQMPYAH7,Hey with a brand like fuji its got to be good,Get tape good quality at a good price. Buy this blank tape.
A1YAKU3QE0F3BW,"It's a printer cable, nothing more","I give it 5 stars because of the price - about $6. Otherwise, it's a cable - works fine with my USB printer. Amazon sent it fast enough considering the shipping was free."
ALZFL8C530W7O,Thank you,"Good product at a good price. Thank you for the prompted delivery, It will be put too good use, I am making tapes for my grand children."
A3NWESUWTJCGAX,very unhappy,"i have ordered this item about a month ago today i still have not recieved my package , if the kind people at amazon would nicely send my package to my address it would be great appericated and i believe that my card has been charged so please do not give me a re fund just send my package yours truly loyal customer karol wojtczak"
A8DV5O0AE04R1,"Beautiful frequency range, look fairly durable.","See title.  Both my wife and I love these, they fit nice, very nice price, look reasonably durable, and the sound range is everything I can hear.  What's not to like?"
A2WEFP1ROS9AWJ,unhappy,"I am unhappy with the Photosmart C200 camera I purchased in November of  1999.  It worked great, and with ease at first.  In May of 2000 it wouldn't  work one day... after numerous phone calls to HP and a high telephone bill  I finally sent mine back to them.  They lost it and never sent me a  replacement.  After many more phone calls I got my replacement in June of  2000, and now this one isn't working.  The first time it was an  &quot;internal communication error&quot; and this time it is an error in  the auto flash they tell me.  So beware, you may be loving it at first but  once you have a problem with it good luck getting a timely response and  help from HP, they keep passing you on to different people and more long  distance calls.  I am now trying to get a full refund for a camera that  will work, since the first time this happened I missed my son's preschool  graduation and my daughter's first birthday, and now am camera-less again  for my son's first day of kindergarten, moments that can't be reproduced to  share with my out of town relatives who got used to seeing things as they  happened making them feel more a part of their grandchildren and the  important things going on in their lives.  My recommendation would  certainly to be not to buy this camera.  I hope you people that are having  good luck with yours continue to have that same luck."
A37HJU31768LC0,Decent headphones...,"I've owned these headphones for over a year now, and they're still going strong. The audio is only decent, not great, and I'm no audiophile. Probably better than the standard ipod headphones though. The build quality is very good - I've been pretty rough on them, yet they're still in very good shape. The in-built volume control is a very handy feature, though I've noticed that when put above the minimum setting, it tends to distort the sound with slight hissing in the background. Nothing terrible, but when I have a choice, I'd much rather increase the volume using my mp3 player, and not the headphones, because that doesn't cause any sound distortion. These headphones have a high max sound volume - I can't imagine anyone wanting the sound any louder than its max possible volume. I haven't tested the sound quality at very high volume settings due to not wanting to damage my ears, but I imagine, like the vast majority of other headphones, there are rather sever sound distortions at the upper sound levels. I find these headphones to be very, very comfortable, to the extent that I often forget I'm even wearing them. Overall, I think there are probably better headphones out on the market for the same price range, especially if you care a lot about sound quality, but if you value comfort, and a hardy design, these headphones are for you."
A1WXU0BY2L7ZL9,Excellent low cost movable arm,"This flat panel mount is adjustable and very cost effective, an excellent product for the money.  This arm comes with all needed mounting hardware for either masonry or wall stud mounting as well as a set of 4 screws for several sizes of panel mounting screws.  It also comes with a small wrench for two different sizes of hex heads on the arm and an allen wrench for one of the arm adjustments.  It is at least a two man operation to attach the flat screen after the arm is attached to the wall.  I mounted mine on a stud in the wall.  For stud mounting you use two of the six mounting hex head lag screws that come with it.  It doesn't say exactly in the directions but you should use a 1/4"" drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the stud.  I would not recommend trying to use the included hex wrench to tighten down the wall mounting lag screws, you need more leverage to tighten it than it provides; use a crescent wrench or other longer hex wrench.  I used a stud finder to locate the studs accurately.  Make sure you do not have obvious pipes or electrical going through the wall at the chosen location.  They can throw off some stud finders.  If you want to quickly adjust one of the arm adjustment screws it also contains a replacement screw that has a slip bar top lever so that it can be loosened and tightened without a wrench.  There is one optional cable management loop that attaches to the bottom of the middle of the arm.  It could use one more at the wall, but that is easy to improvise.  The flat panel we have is 32"" and 25 lbs. and works well for the mounting arm.I really like this product for this price."
A2EWDDFGIJY5TU,canon lenses,"Great product, it is exactly what I wanted and would advise anyone who wanted this type of lens to purchase this one.  It arrived a day earlier than I expected it, was packaged well so as not to be damaged. Am very pleased with this purchase."
A9NF4UXICFQ1,"Inexpensive, but not cheap!","This well-made and low-priced computer repair set doesn't compromise quality for price, and it has every useful tool you'll need for working inside a computer case."
AAUL5SESPJ5PJ,"What a great product, the most expandable palm os!","I just bought a Visor graphite, what a great product! It is expandable with lots of cool modules, including an MP3 player. Can be expanded with 8mb ram modules, and supports all Palm OS applications. The OS is update-able by installing patches.  The buttons have a nice responsive feel to them, and it hot syncs fast with the USB port, the hard cover is nice too. The datebook plus is a visor exclusive and has more features than the regular datebook that is also included. It also has a world time program, and an advanced calculator that turns my visor into the ultimate device. Lots of freeware availible for the Palm OS, which is nice! The visor deluxe just adds 8mb of ram, which I don't need yet. If I do need 8mb in the future, I just buy the expansion module!  It can also beam with any palm device that has an IR port.  Great purchase.  I like the fact that the contrast can be adjusted by an on screen &quot;button&quot; too."
A1QCAFP6OK5IY2,Corrupts data,"I purchased this with a new PC to make moving some files and settings over easy. It did connect after some tinkering with XP's networking but most of the files were corrupted in the transfer so I ended up having to move the files to a drive on my old PC and then install the drive on the new one. Don't know if this is trustworthy enough for other uses if you want to network two PCs, it didn't do the job for me. (Note I was using XP 64 on both machines and NTSC file system.)"
A39LVIRARCGI1E,It fits. It's a UV filter.,It fits my Nikon 300 mm lens and it's a UV filter. Not a lot more you can say :).
A1ZVFCPHCWFV71,No frills protection for a lens,The UV-ness is not that necessary for DSLRs since they have built-in UV filters but protecting the front element of the lens is still something I do. I did not notice image quality degradation nor incread ghosting/flaring.
A1JW9M56RDN0MR,Ipaq H3650 vs Palm V,"I've had the Palm V for about a year before I was able to buy this Ipaq 3650.  The Ipaq is really awesome!  Compared to the Palm V, here are some of the positive and negative sides:Positive:-This beats the Palm in almost every way possible.  Clear and bright screen that is perfectly viewable in sunlight.  Not to mention that it's also crisp color as well.  The brightness is totally adjustable and there's even a sensor that you can set so it will automatically adjust the brightness accordingly.  Very cool.-The hotsync speed blows away the Palm.  What's also very nice is that it can dynamically sync with your Outlook mail, contacts, calendar, notes, etc.  If you have the Ipaq already connected in the cradle and you're sorting and deleting your email on your desktop, the Ipaq will instaneously synchronize every delete/add that you make on your desktop.  With the Palm,  you have to press the hotsync button everytime or schedule a hotsync.  With the Ipaq, you just plug it in and forget about it.-The integrated Windows Media Player is awesome.  It's basically an integrated Mp3 player that can play any mp3.  You now have music on the go and plus you can plug in headphones to your Ipaq, and listen to your music at work.-You can also record with the built-in microphone your voice or voice reminders-Everything with Outlook - Contacts, Emails, Calendar appears the exact same way as it does on your Ipaq.-Very accurate Handwriting recognition.  One of the best selling points for the Apple PDA is now available for the Ipaq.  Same technology and accuracy that the Newtons run on.-With the Palm V, you're limited to the amount of memory you can store of only 2MB or 8MB if you have the Vx.  With the Compact Flash Card, you can store up to whatever your compact flash can hold.  Currently, it's at 1GB.  That's a lot of mp3s.-Overall, it looks very cool (Matrix silver) and it's the fastest and most top of the line PocketPC you can buy out there on the market.  And because it's so hard to get, it just raises the cool factor even higher.  =)Some of the negative sides-Doesn't come with a serial cable.  So people running NT have to purchase this cable separately.-Size.  It is a little bulkier than the sleek Palm V, but it still fits in my pocket and I can carry it in my bag.-Accessories are hard to find and anything related to this item (including the Ipaq itself) is hard to find.  Too bad a hard cover case isn't available yet for this.  I'm still looking btw.-Software.  There's much more third party software out there available for Palm than there is for PocketPC.  Go figure...Palm owns 70% marketshare for PDAs.  This will slowly change.Overall...the Ipaq is very nice.  If you can afford one and find one available, I really suggest this as a very good strong buy."
A3R37EX54XC8Q5,good buy,"Received the items in a well packaged envelope.  They appeared to be new.(some others stated that they looked used).  Each does what it is designed to do.  I think it should be noted that these filters give a modest result, and don't give an exaggerated result.  They enhance the photos and don't change them.  Plus, with the expensive lenses I have, they provide protection from scratches and possible breakage if dropped."
A2IR5Y4R3VI4TS,All you ever wanted in headphones!,"I read the reviews for these headphones and purchased them from Amazon. I was very pleased with them!Here's why: for one thing, they're very comfy. They fit right on the head, and they were gentle enough on my sensitive just-pierced ears. I also loved the long 10 ft cord- it gives you lots of freedom. The sound quality is GREAT!The only flaw I found was that there are volume controls on each side of the 'phones (for each ear) and I didn't really see the point in being able to turn one ear's volume up and the other one down.Other than that, I enjoyed these headphones."
