A97M5R3SWXB6C,Wi-fi works,I got this for my daughter's computer that I got on ebay.  It was a Dell computer off lease that didn't have built in Wi-Fi.  I didn't have any difficulty installing it or getting it to work.  It picks up our Wi-Fi signal very well.
A1Y1OGOLHXW1WB,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this mouse, but so far, it's amazingly durable.  Very accurate, and the two available buttons on the side are great for gaming.  The scroll wheel offers nice feedback, so you can tell it's scrolling.  I did find it surprisingly small, more along the lines of a portable mouse to throw in a backpack, which isn't what i was expecting, but it still fits my hand well."
A1NDBLPVWB3CTF,Fintie Slim Fit Folio Case Cover Support Automatic Sleep/Wake Feature for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch Tablet GT-N5100 / N5110 -,"Fits Samsung Galaxy Note 8 just right.  The package reads, ""fits up to 7-inch tablet,"" but you can see that it was actually made for the Note 8."
A3MMR2WDKAK0PA,Can handle Virtual DJ Audio and video mixing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"UPDATED: 4-9-13I bought this mainly to use my Virtual DJ music video automixer for the gym.  Watching music videos mixing really kills time on the elliptical for me.  I was skeptic that the Atom processor couldn't handle it but I'm happy to announce that it can handle like a charm using only 50% of CPU power.Note, there are 2 models: one with dock and one without.  For $40 more, you can get the add on keyboard dock bundled with the tablet.  The keyboard dock cost $125 by itself.Here's the rest of my review of the tablet:1. Style & Design:  I was never a big fan of Acer styling of laptops but I'm very impress with this tablet.  It's light, thin, simple design, clean lines, and a nice grey/white 2 tone.  Texture feels very premium and not cheap.  The white border feels like it's made of metal while the backing is a grey plastic.  I'm a art major and I know good from bad design and Acer did a good job with this tablet.  10"" a perfect size for portability and 11"" just feels weird and large to use as a tablet.  Touchscreen is very responsive.  More responsive than the HP Envy X2 which I returned.2. Atom Processor woes:  I was never a big fan with Atom CPU back in the days but I'm impress with this new gen of Atom. It can handle office, web browsing, hd video & streaming, light photoshop, and Virtual DJ audio and video mixing!!  Just don't play hardcore 3D games. This laptop is not meant to be workhorse.  It's meant to be a second laptop for your productivity on the go that does everything the crippled Ipad can't.  Buy only what you need as technology changes very often!4.  BLUETOOTH: Bluetooth by default is turn off and hidden inside win 8 setting.  I use this with my GoGroove BT Headphone and works great so far.5. 64 GIG Micro SD:  I using a Scandisk 64gig MicroSD and it's reading it with no issues.  I know alot of people not sure if the tablet can take 64gig.6.  KEYBOARD:  The key board feels very premium with no flex. There's only one full USB available.  The bundle is only $550 from Amazon. Other places sell the same bundle for $699.7. Get a T3HUB:  I would suggest get this. This will add more USB input for your tablet.  T3HUB is the only SELF POWERED USB hub I know that does not required external power.. It is  not a splitter.  So your portable hard drive which rely on more power will work.8. Windows 8 START BUTTON:  Microsoft is having some miss steps with Windows 8 and removing START BUTTON is one of their issue. You can get it back by going to: ninite.com , scroll down to the middle and install ""Classic Start"". Ninite is a great site that help you install all the free tools you need for your windows.9. Cons:  It can get hot in the back of the tablet.There's no digital pen.  If you want to use the tablet for digital pen note taking, this is not for you.  Try Lenovo Thinkpad 2, or Samsung.There's some bloatware. Just remove it."
A28ESDJPORMVEY,Wireless outdoor speaker,I brought this item based on price. I wanted to be able to listen to my Sirius portable radio while relaxing on my back porch. The radio (that I carry to work everyday) and back is plugged in in the kitchen. This wireless speaker sends the signal to the speaker. It plays great while sitting on the porch.
ARRY34GBBVQ0U,Great inexpensive Blu-ray player,"First off, I purchased this player to play my old standard DVD collection as an upgrade replacement to an old noisy fading 10 year old Toshiba player. The Panasonic plays standard DVD's,  Scratched Library DVD's, My own burned DVD +R and - R's (DVD's I burned on a computer and from a DVD recorder) with no problems, no freezing, or hesitating at all. I did play a Blu-ray (Cars 2) and had 2 Disc versions of the movies to compare. There is a big difference of image quality even on on my 720p 26"" Vizio. The Blu-ray quality is spectacular. The player is quiet when playing DVD's and Blu-rays. Only a little expected quiet ""clunking"" when loading or navigating a disc. This is one of the reasons I opted for this over the LG BD630. Both entry level (around $80) players were highly rated by Consumers Reports but I read reviews that the LG was noisy, and had problems reading burned discs.I don't have this player connected to an ethernet cable and I know there are problems with it in that respect. So if you don't do the Netflix / Streaming thing this is a good choice. The Panasonic also plays JPEGS on DVD's and CD's and USB Flash Drives. It does load my JPEG's (From a 10 megapixel camera) slowly though. I could never get it to play MP3's on a Flash Drive, but it played MP3's burned to a DVD just fine.Another interesting point is there is a resume feature on DVD's but not Blu-rays. I've read that Blu-ray Java (BD-J) discs do not let you resume the disc where you left off after you hit stop once (and turn the power off) It's a function of the Blu-ray Disc and not the player!  So if you're watching a Blu-ray movie, hit stop to get a snack then press play it'll play from the beginning again. The manual does state it can't resume Blu-rays, however there are Blu-ray discs with bookmarks and resume features included.Update: This Panasonic and other players can resume Blu-rays if included in the disc. I found out you can use bookmark features built into some Blu-ray discs or just hit stop, turn off the power button and continue later. You might have to sit thru the short Legal / Warning disclaimers again, but it resumes shortly after that. The Onscreen prompt will ask if you'd like to continue or not.Note: This unit does not come with an HDMI Cable. I keep reading reviews where buyers complain it's missing. It's tricky but the Manual is for both the DMP-BD75 and the DMP-BD755. On page 8 the diagram states that the HDMI cable only comes with the BD755. On page 4 under ""Supplied Accessories"" They put a box around BD755 indicating it's only included for that model. It's a little confusing. On the other hand the product description on Amazon and the box itself don't list the HDMI as included."
A2DYIX3UCF74L4,worth every penny!,"This is the arduino you are looking for! The built in wireless is easy to configure and gives you so much flexibility.  I use mine to light a media cabinet and will be adding a notification system soon.  So if I'm watching TV and I get an important email, I will see a light notification. Same could be done with Facebook, twitter, weather, or just about any other web service.  The only complaint is the lack of onboard memory for sketches."
A1NJ1Y2365UT51,Works fine,"What can I say?  It went in the device and seems to work fine.  There are now generally class 10 memory cards, but the camera I put this in didn't seem to care."
A363S7O3VF7KO9,Good enough...,"I had some experience with the retractable version of this cable.  I bought this for my wife's car so having something that retracted out of sight when not in use was handy.  However, the cable stopped working after about a year or so, the constant stress at the attachment point from the retractor must have made the wires fray.  This product takes up a bit more room, but there's a bin in the car to stow it, so no big deal.  And it works, and should continue to do so.I'm connecting a Garmin 760w to the audio aux input of a Odyssey stereo - works fine!"
ARTST8JB04TBC,Love This Mouse!,"First off, let me say that the clamshell case that the Logitech Wireless Mouse comes in is the easiest opening clamshell EVER. I know this is a silly thing to talk about in a review, but how many times have you struggled with a knife or scissors or whatever trying to get a clamshell open? This one comes with an easy open back that peels away with just your fingers. That feature's worth three stars all by itself. :)The mouse itself is lightweight, very ergonomic for either the right or left-handed user. Installation is a no-brainer. Simply plug in the micro-receiver and that's it. The mouse even comes with batteries! One feature I really like is that the mouse comes with a built-in storage space for the micro-receiver within the mouse itself for easy travel.Performance is flawless and the price is right. Highly recommended!"
A1L04XZ7MTAI7Z,Amazing Camera Quality but Poor Software Implementation,"The hardware camera/picture quality and usability  is amazing but I am forced to give this only two stars due to the following very serious flaws:1. The motion detection is far far too sensitive and there is NO WAY AT ALL for one to adjust the sensitivity.  This means that each and every time that the lighting changes in the room such as a cloud passing by, or twice a day when switching into/out of infrared mode (i.e. night mode) you will receive a motion alert - rendering the device alerts almost useless as you will receive several false positives (at a minimum!) each and every day. The Dropcam forums have been filled with complaints about this for roughly a year now.2. At the very LOWEST resolution setting you will be using up 30 GB of your ISP budget each and every month (60GB in HD mode).  Many, if not most, people will go over their ISP limited bandwidth budget this way. Speaking of bandwidth, when you run the device (which ONLY operates over WiFi) your internet will slow to a crawl unless you are on a fast internet plan - forget buying this if your are on a 1.5 Mps connection or slower and you want to do anything else on the internet while the device is on.3. EVERYTHING is recorded and lasts at least a week with no easy/practical way to delete it - so if you forgot that your dropcam was on and you happen to get your morning coffee in some partial state of undress - congratulations, you're awesome nakedness is on the cloud server for a full week with no way to delete it save for submitting a request to delete the entire week's recording.4. Worst - There is no/nada/ZERO way to connect this appliance to anything else you own - it only sends imagery back to Dropcam.com. You will be COMPLETELY dependent on your $10 a month subscription to use this device.  Without the subscription you can only watch imagery live rendering the device practically useless as a security device without the monthly fee (give away the razor and sell the blades, I guess)Although the sound and imaginary are superior and the night-vision is amazing, I can not recommend this camera until dropcam addresses the above flaws."
AXX6LD62OHW51,Works great for how I'm using it,"I am using this in a Samsung Series 7 developer build tablet to expand its hard drive capacity (only comes with 64gb SSD). It has worked great so far, and I have been able to install and run software from this SDHC."
ADOR3TR7GDF68,perfect 10/10 however,Not the best! you can not have your keyboard and this cover on at the same time. Well you could but the cover will not close. I knew this before I mad the purchase and had the bottom cut off and sown together. Perfect for me. the keyboard is the screen cover.
AUX5W667RO35H,Great Sleve for Tablets,"I bought this sleeve in pink to fit my Lenovo Tablet. My tablet also is in a folio and I was worried this case wouldn't hold my tablet when it was in the folio.  I havn't had a problem with it.  Because it has a large strip of velcro and no zipper, it could probably fit a larget tablet if need be.  It seems very strong and the fabric is thick.  I should have no problem carrying it in my school bag in between classes.  Great purchase for only being $8."
A23QG3Y6FZEZO6,Great for the price.,"For the price, this a pretty good lens. You have to have steady hands in order to catch fast moving objects (like motorcycles). At full zoom, I think the pictures aren't extremely sharp but still passable.The picture of the green motorcycle racer is one of the pics I submitted.I use this lens when I need more reach than the kit lens but don't necessarily want to pull out the big 500mm Sigma."
A1JJOV69MAU2J2,The little stick of fun...,"The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.Enter Shuffle.I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.Enjoy!"
AXQKNGDI2SUKI,Perfect for my living room,"I love my Touchstone Charging Dock! It turns my TouchPad into a piece of art in my living room.This is the best way to charge a device. There are no plugs and wires coming from the TouchPad and it puts in in a nice display fashion where ever you want! I have mine set up to show the clock and cycle through artsy backgrounds. It keeps the device charged, but can sometimes make it a little warm to the touch."
AB5T1M4WX7HVE,It works.,I needed to use this adapter to run a second monitor on my computers.  I did notice some worked without issues while others the computer auto detect would detect and then drop the second monitor.  Covering the pin 19 fixed that issue.  I can not say for sure this was the adapters fault.
A2Z183MNV4D7IY,Great,I take a lot of pictures and never come close to filling this. It works great just like I expected.
A1XE3M22N91451,Better to have some and never need than need and not have - by far,"They're cheapThey clamp stuffThey have softer plastic jaws that don't scratch things or puncture reflectorsThere's six of themYou can clamp them all together in a chain like Barrel'o'monkeysThe inner radius of the round opening is JUST RIGHT for backdrop stands (mine anyway)And that's about all I have to say about that(thanks, Forrest)Good deal, seem sturdy enough and get the job done"
A3Q0YHKN5TESTQ,Did not fit my Canon 75-300 lens...too big,"Be careful when you order, there are 3 different 75-300 mm Canon lenses. Amazon just issued a credit and I ordered another. Thanks Amazon for making it so easy"
A26I5Q4CBBJUSR,"Its a great product, need I say more","Its intel, its lighting fast, heavy duty, sturdy, and feels solid to the touch,(no pun intended) This you can tell they didn't use cheep parts to put this together, and it hasn't let me down yet. Got it fix behind the motherboard, and there are no overheating problems. Its a good pick"
A27AF4DLLOBQDQ,First Experience Review,"Just got this baby less than 24 hours ago.  So this review covers initial impressions, ease of setup, etc.OK, I use this for a bedroom TV, using OTA (over the air) tv signal.  I also have the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) functioning via WIFI.Packaging - box weighs about 15 lb, so this is light weight.  This can be good or bad, we will see.  Being light weight helps ensure safe shipping, so that is good.  Arrived from Amazon, via UPS, in good shape.Open to watching TV was probably 45 minutes - this included changing antennas (requiring 2 scans).  I pulled off foam blocks, removed from plastic bag, located the base and attaching screw.  The base is held on with a single screw, Allen wrench included.  Easy peasy.  Set on stand, attach power cord, put batteries in remote, connect antenna.On power up, asks for either home use, or store demo, what type of signal (cable or antenna), and then scans for channels.  The bedroom is on the second floor, and the antenna is a Mohu Leaf - so I was able to pull in plenty of stations, with very good signal quality.Next I setup Netflix, and Amazon Prime - this probably takes 15 minutes for both.  Typing in the passwords with the remote is tedious, but that is the same with all remotes, and long passwords.Initial impression of picture/sound quality - this is a 720p TV, so that considered, very good.  sound is fine, and allows external speakers.Price is very good, and overall value is high.  Vizio makes a great consumer level product, and this is no exception.I generally only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products, so you may find my 4 star rating a bit low.  Easy to recommend, especially given the price."
A1U85CV19M9V15,Electrical tape in a hard to find width.,I needed some black tape that was in this length to do some stripes on a car. Don't ask : ) But this fit the bill. After using it. This compares to other high quality elec tape. I can tell the difference between this and crappy elec tape and this is no crappy electrical tape.
A3F7U41ZW2FPE8,One of the best MP3 FM transmitters,One of the best MP3 FM transmitters that I have used. It is very durable and it's in the middle when it comes to price... not too high and not too low. I've found you usually get what you pay for. I am very happy with it.
A3RU2P4FAACQ1J,Best case to keep your camera ultra-compact,"I bought this along with my SD 450 and I love it. This is only a good case if you have an ultracompact camera (like the ones listed in the product title) and want to KEEP it ultracompact. That's why I got it, and if you don't care about ease of shoving your camera in your pocket, then don't bother with this one.There is obviously no place for anything but the camera, and I don't see an issue with that. If you get a 1GB memory card, that should be all you need. And if you want to keep your camera super portable, then why have a need for an extra battery in your pocket anyway? If you really want that, get a bigger case (probably not the PSC 50 though, which may actually damage your camera).However, this case is much more stylish than the PSC 50 as the quality is obviously very good, and the very official looking Canon logos on the flap and wrist strap make it look even better. Plus, it's a perfectly snug fit to keep dust, dirt, and scratches from your camera, which to me is the whole point in getting a camera case (i.e. not for extra storage space). I've dropped it on my carpeted floor a couple of times and it has been just fine (then again, I've tripped into a wall with the camera and nothing happened to it at all because it's a Canon). I've only used it for a couple of weeks, but my camera has no blemishes whatsoever and everyone thinks the case looks cute and posh. I definitely like its wriststrap better than the one that came with my camera.The biggest drawback is that you have to pass the wriststrap through a hole every time you want to take it out, which means that it could take up to 10 seconds for you to get your camera out and then turn it on. I don't know how they could've improved this though, and I like being able to hold it very securely through the case with the strap. Plus, the magnetic button partially makes up for it since it makes it easier to put away. The belt loop on the back can be quite handy as well.In summary, if you don't mind not having space for extras and you don't mind pushing the strap through the hole on top for removal (though the hole is fairly large), then you definitely won't be disappointed with this. It's especially easy on your wallet. I would still buy a screen protector for your LCD though, because this case can only protect the screen while it's actually in there ;)Oh, and don't be careless with your screen. If you put the screen in facing the front of the case then it couldn't possibly get scratched by the button."
A1PWOYRZTULNF1,Wish I had not bought this!,Bought this card to replace the OE HP wireless network card which caused the BOD on my laptop.  NO improvement with the new card. Perhaps it is just a design flaw.  Shipping from China did not take too long but the card functions no better than the card supplied from HP.  Guess I'll stick to the usb adapter.
A1UMPW5EU5G2AP,would buy again,like every camera they all have their neat features easy to use read the book to get the most from your camera compact
ALRCAGJOJ9583,"Works very well, easy to use","This unit was very simple to set up and install. Simply reverse the batteries, plug it into the wall, and then plug in the devices you wish to protect into the back. There is a center button that you can use to turn the unit off (it is strange that you can't just unplug it, because that simulates a power failure, so the unit turns on if you unplug).I use this for my desktop tower and computer with 26"" monitor (actually an HDTV). I also plugged in my DVD player for surge protection.I had a 5 minute power failure a few days after installing and, by chance, was using the computer at the time. The computer continued without a glitch allowing me to save and shut down. There was very little drain on the battery, which indicated between 30 and 40 minutes of time available.All told, it worked very well. Cons are it is a bit noisy when supplying power from the battery (it is quiet otherwise.) The manual is also terrible, although there isn't much to have to know."
A3PPO2X5PJE1L9,works great with your 70-200mm F/2.8L IS,"This is a great way to turn your f/2.8L IS 70-200 into a f/5.6L 140-400mm lens. Yes, you do lose 2 full stops, so that will limit your low-light capabilities. However, with an IS lens you can still hand-hold this combination. (even though it will be much more stable on a monopod or tripod)You still keep the auto-focus ability and the great performance of the 70-200 L-series.The extender comes in a protective bag and is small enough to keep in a vest pocket when in the field.I do not do enough long-range photography to make the purchase of a 400L or even 300L practicable, but I find this to be a good substitute for my needs."
A2DCRFRP1ZIE,funtions as expected,"This hood connects well to my lens.  It has a good tight fit and is a solid hood.  I feel it is a little too reflective on the inside of the hood however I have not seen any light distortion in any of the pictures I've taken with it yet.  I have not tried the more expensive Canon brand hood so I do not have a basis for comparison.  However, this hood does everything I need it to do so I cannot justify spending more money on a similar product."
ABSYIF0ONC2AF,worked great until approx one year,"I got two pairs of these for my iMac. They worked great for a year and one or two of them just started acting up. What happened is that my iMac just crashes and when it boots, it tells me that one or more memory banks are bad (3 really loud beeps that run continuously until you turn off the computer and fix the problem). I'm still working on getting a replacement, and I will update my review depending on how Corsair treats me.I really regret not buying from Crucial instead. I've never had any problems with their products.UPDATE: Getting a replacement was easy and took approximately two weeks. Corsair has decent customer service. I may trust their memory for PCs but I will still think twice about getting memory for my Mac(s)."
A28HR96PNS584C,Small,This unit is small enough to fit on the dash of my bike with a little velcro.Tunes in well overall a nice little unit.
A3740P37HEEWL4,Small but versitile!,"This product works great on light-weight cameras. It's not intended for anything heaver than a shirt pocket type digital camera but it works great for those. I have a GoPro Hero 2 and needed a way to video myself. With the GoPro field of view, my arm is not quite long enough to get a good shot. This extension is perfect! Just hold it out and point the camera back at yourself and voila - works like a champ! Also does a good job with my Canon M85 when you need to shoot above the heads of a crowd. Just set the camera on self timer and raise it up to get the shot. I love this thing!"
A1FNVDWQOCGHP6,"LOOOOOOOOVE IT, EPIC SPEEDS!!!!",Sometimes I get read/write speeds higher than the specs!! You need an SSD to get to higher speeds because HDD bottleneck it
A2UP5928N088L0,She Loves It,"I purchased these headphones for my wife who tells me that she thinks they are just wonderful. I put them on and they are very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. They are attached to a laptop, most of the time, and are used for watching movies and listening to music. I haven't found a ""mushy middle"" with these and the bass and highs are crisp and clear with no vibrations in the lower end, too.These are great headphones and since my wife loves them, so do I. :)"
A2UBPXUBTVDKWJ,Amazing Card!,"I purchased this card mostly for gaming but I also do a little video editing.  I have to say, I am totally blown away.  I was hesitant to spend so much for just a video card.  I ended up doing much research and came to the conclusion that this card would be best for me at the price point.  Also it jumped considerably to the 780 and of course the Titan which I was considering.  I could do SLI configuration with these for the price of a titan so I went this route.For those of you who know gaming, Arma II and II as well as the mod DayZ with the updated nVidia drivers, I can MAX everything and still get around a steady 55-65fps.  Of course the other reviews on the build I did help, but if you are looking at this card, you already know that and know what you are looking for.I would totally recommend this product to anyone.  I have had this for about 6 months now and it just begs for me to throw more at it.I did not need the SC(Super Clocked) model but I was ready to buy and it was not available.  Even got a free back plate for it from NVidia which was running at the time and I was unaware.  It is quiet and runs cool in my full tower case.  It may be a little more expensive but I chose it over ATi mainly because NVidia is known for performing better apples to apples against it and of course support.  Do it... you wont be disappointed!!!!"
A1N2YIV18FE8T1,Works!,"I reformatted to NTFS as a preference and this thing just plain works.  I received an out of memory error when transferring my MP3s (large file, over 44 gig) but it was due to error in Vista (fix is with SP1).  I hear a soft buzz coming from the power adapter not the drive, when plugged in.  All in all, perfect device for music, pics, and videos.  Great price and great product!"
A3OEE8468LMYE8,Hickups a little,"I bought this player to allow my wife to watch soaps on her TV (after the VCR would no longer record shows broadcast in digital).  Shows are now recorded with a digital tuner in a PC and then sent via wireless network to her TV.  This works fairly well to display content on an older standard definition TV.  Online content, pictures and music streams too but we seldom use those features.  We do have trouble with hickups and halts when the streaming data rate required exceeds the player's bandwidth.  I'm not sure what is required to speed up connectivity to my 300 Mbs dual-band wireless router but this player seems to be limited to 50 Mbs and a single band."
A3NZEQJJZEZROW,Best Wireless Keyboard,I have one of these and when my wife's Microsoft keyboard went out I did not hesitate to replace it with keyboard. The keyboard is the K350 and the mouse is the M510. The mouse doesn't work as well. I have downloaded the latest Set-Point from Logitech and the mouse is very hard to control. I have the M705 mouse on the other set and it works fine.
A287VLPMWOGYS9,OK for the money,"I just am finishing installing this camera in my 2012 Mustang Coupe:  Pyle PLCM32 3.5-Inch TFT LCD Monitor with Universal Mount Rear View and Backup Color CMD Distance Scale Line CameraI tested the camera and monitor using a 12v plug with bare wires since I heard some of this manufacturer's items come DOA.I spent most of the time mounting the camera on the bumper overhang over the license plate, connecting the black wire to a ground and using a multimeter to determine which wire was the backup light wire.I routed the video wire to the front, getting as far as the left side of the dash. I'll need to get a F-F RCA adapter to use a spare short M-M video cable as an extension.I still have the camera powered from the 12v plug at present.So far, so good.This camera will also be confirmation I got the manual shifter into reverse. I sometimes miss that since I have to push down."
A3GCWUIQOKZE5S,Unexpected Gem of a Receiver! Outstanding Value.,"OK.  If you're reading this review, my advice is to BUY this receiver!  I was looking at comparable products from the ""big names"" and they are all at least 50% to 100% more money.  When I got this unit (fast delivery by UPS incidentally), I was amazed at how substantial and ""nice"" it was for under 300 bucks.  Make sure that you get the wi-fi network adapter that plugs into the front panel USB port.  That gives you wireless internet access, and you will want that.  First and foremost, the build quality is first rate.  All the buttons and knobs feel good and the fit and finish of the exterior is excellent.  In addition, this unit is heavy and substantial, unlike some competing units that are so light weight that they slip around on the shelf when you press a button.  This unit has a comforting heft to it that makes you feel like you spent a lot more money on it.  I hooked up my phono (an old B&O phono with mm cartridge) and was pleased to know that the unit does have its own phono preamp.  And I hooked up an old Denon CD deck that I've had since the '80s.  The Onkyo handled both of these sources beautifully.  The big test for me was the ""net"" function.  But by following the instructions carefully I was able to sync up to my home wifi network in a few minutes.  Also, I was able to engage Pandora in another few minutes.  I played Pandora for hours with no problems to my family's delight. The on-screen instructions are a bit cryptic, but if you're patient, you won't have any trouble with it.  As for the sound, I found that this Onkyo provides a very neutral and high-end sound that, again, was unexpected from the low cost of the unit.  The controls on the front panel are simple and easy to use.  The one little complaint I would offer is that I would like for Onkyo to have included more digital inputs on the rear panel. At least another USB input.  But this is a minor issue in view of the overall excellence of the unit.  Go ahead and check around at competing units for 2-channel stereo and you will not find a competing unit thats as good as this Onkyo 8050 for anywhere near the cheap price offered by Amazon."
A3SS6919NRQ2MF,Hands Down Winner!,"Decided to replace a bulky but otherwise excellent Yamaha CD-C600 5 disc changer with a single disc player. Took a chance on the C-7030 based on my good experience with other Onkyo components and the mostly excellent reviews of this CD player. The first player was returned/exchanged without any hassle to Amazon immediately as it didn't play right. The replacement sounds phenominal with only a few hours on it. Will only get better with time. IMHO, it's every bit as ""Natural Sounding"" as the Yamaha. This is a high quality well constructed dedicated CD player without any unneeded ""bells and whistles."" Great sound and a bargain to boot. I don't think you can go wrong with this player if you're looking for straight forward good sounding music. A genuine ""hands down winner!"""
A2K4DYIYN73JP1,So-So,"Antenna does give better reception than the two rabbit ears digital antennas I tried but still must be turned a little this way and that to bring in the same persistently annoying channels we originally were having problems. Clearly an outside antenna is what is needed, but the Terk has made most of our viewing a little easier."
APJRP57VKZPLN,Light & Handy,I like that it is light and small. But sound is great & the bluetooth works well. I love it!
A1KYJA5YM1479G,Great portable chord!,I love the retractable chords because they are so easy to carry everywhere! I am always untangling chords and this solves that  problem!
A2ZIYV6Y9FLYEC,Feeling connected!,"The LG Blue Ray Disc Player is easy to set up and offers a host of online streaming options. After reading a lot of reviews, I selected this player and have no regrets."
A1ASIHQ9NMYQB,SanDisk Ultra 16GB SDHC,The SanDisk Ultra 16GB SDHC Card works just great with my new Samsung Digital Camera. Its very fast at recovery times.
A1J2JXOWJMWNKM,Love these!,"I'm not a super-pro when it comes to headphones nor did I want to bust the bank getting a pair of new headphones for my Ipad/Ipod. So I read lots of the reviews and did an average to find headphones that were stylish, affordable and good quality and I think that I've definitely found a winner with these! I love that the ears (??) turn sideways so that they're easy to store more flatly instead of poking out of my case (which was a concern for me with moving from earbuds to a headset). The sound quality is perfect for me and on top of that they're very comfortable. I didn't really like the earbuds because after a while they start to hurt inside my ears, but these are so soft and cushiony that I can keep them on for hours and not even notice. For the price, they're definitely worth it and I would highly recommend them for persons who just want really good headphones but aren't seeking ones that let them hear every single note or that silent pin dropping in the back of the recording studio!"
A2BQ6X8737AA65,Quieter than my PSU,"For what it does, it does it well for a good price. The sucks hot air out of my computer while being less noisy than my power-supply fan. The PSU plugs are also nice and slick, so it's easy to plug into or remove."
A3IUI5VN3J92SK,Must have,This is a must have if you have the FreeAgent Go.  I keep this at my desk at work and dock my Go there each day.  I can't imagine not having this dock ... it's well worth the money!
A1EAH433QK3L3E,it works,"VERY easy to use,at a very inexpensive price. It really is a pleasure to have a cleaning product that does not give off horrible smelling fumes, I used it on both my Asus monitor, Phillips Television."
A3P1TPSDT2SI74,Extremely poor quality... But wait!,"Ok so first off I looked at the reviews on this product and had no idea what was going on. An almost equal number of reviewers gave it 5 and 1 stars and and almost equal number of reviewers gave it 4 and 2 stars. And then there were a bunch of guys that decided they were on nobody's side and played it safe with 3 stars. So I decided that it was too hard to judge this product from the reviews. So I ordered them to see for myself. At like $23 bucks, it was a steal if at least a large % of the discs worked.So I get the discs today and they were packaged beautifully in Amazon's frustration free packing. 5 stars for the packaging. I opened them and decided to get my burning on! I pop the first disc in and try to burn something on it. It failed even before it wrote anything onto the disc. It gave me a ""could not perform disc-at-once yada yada"" error. This was using Nero with my Sony Optiarc drive with Win 7 64bit, 7,200 RPM HDD and 4 gigs of RAM. Hard drive has been defragmented and the drive has the latest firmware on it. This drive has never given me any problems with burning. I have had minimal coasters with dual layer DVDs and an even smaller number of coasters with single layer DVDs. So I figure I would go again with the same disc. Same problem. So I toss that disc aside and pop another one in. Same problem. Toss that aside, another disc. Same problem. This goes on for about 10 discs. I then try another burning program (ImgBurn). Same exact error. And then I try on another computer. Same error. So at this point I had decided that these discs were absolute rubbish.Now why have I given this product 2 stars instead of 1? Here's why. Amazon has an excellent return policy. These discs are super cheap. Many users have reported getting different brands of discs (these discs are not made by Amazon. They are made by different companies and then Amazon slaps their sticker on them). It is possible that Amazon sources these discs from different companies at different times. This might also explain the constant crazy fluctuation of the price for these discs. So some batches are obviously good, while others... not so much. So here is my advice. Like I said before, these discs are super cheap. As long as you have some time, you have nothing to lose by ordering them. If you get a good batch, great! You have just got a bunch of fairly decent, low cost discs. If you get a box of duds (like I did), just toss the discs back in the really convenient frustration free Amazon packing, print out a return label from Amazon, slap it on the box and give it to your postman. Problem solved. For free (unless you are counting the cents you spent on printing ink, and tape).So give it a chance (just one, no more). you may get lucky."
A31E98RNXH473T,Questionable QC - Not worth the gamble,"Prior to purchasing, I had read glowing reviews regarding the speed and value.  I also happened to see a couple users that warned about corrupted data.  Due to the attractive price, I bought two of these cards.  After using them, both reviews are correct.  The cards are very fast AND prone to corruption (at least one of the cards that I have).After shooting over 100 pics one day on vacation in Maui, the data became corrupted and could not access any of the images through the camera or computer.  Fortunately I had some data rescue software (RescuePro, rec'd free with a SanDisk III Extreme card) that was able to retrieve all but one image but what a headache (and anxiety!).As attractive as the price is, I will not buy it again.  Even if another card may cost a few dollars more...it is worth it.  If you persist in buying this card, then invest in some good data recovery software because you will likely be using it."
A1OG15TGMFHP6Y,You get what you order.,"This product is exactly what you are ordering. Great quality, no problems. I'm very satisfied. I currently have three monitors set up to my PC, and I wanted a longer HDMI cable to connect my TV to my setup too, and this did the job."
A2S488ENSE2HRP,works,"what do you say about an hdmi cable? it works, its long. its a cord. awesome. buy it if you want a long hdmi cord. lol"
A39PFTYRG8TA4P,Great battery life to record more,I have been using it for the past many years and love this batter for the extra power it provides. Without this the normal battery might last may be upto 30min only. Worth buying for $50 and its the best price I was able to find online.ThanksKiran
A918FR9LOWPH5,Tack Sharp for an ultra wide!,I love love love this lens!I am blown away by the quality considering the price.It pairs very nicely with my Canon 6D full frame camera. Since this is a manual lens I just set my camera to shutter priority. I used live view to zoom in to tweak the focus. I found that after f 5.6 pretty much everything is in good focus anyway using zone focusing.The contrast is a wee bit high but certainly not objectionable. The contrast was even less of an issue when shooting raw. I am amazed at the corner to corner sharpness as compared to my Canon 17-40mm L lens.If you don't mind manually focusing and changing F stops old school the lens will love you back! Now I want to buy the 85mm 1.4!
A3CRO2C5FNIXDC,Very helpful,This has been very useful to split the standard power supply for my security hard drive/box. would recommend if you plan on 8 camera setup or 4 with added mics.
A3APYWFBBRANU3,Swindler. Stay away.,This s not the same item as in the ad on Amazon.It is a cheaper substitute.It is Plastic crap shape like a green apple.The cables are too short to reach from the top of the monitor to the back of the PC.You need to shout into the microphone in order to be heard.I do not like being played for the fool.I am going to return it today.
A3QMP2PHU1X8LO,BL-C10A Security Camera,"Product was easy to install (this is my second one). Access to them from the Web is great, even from my smart phone."
A3HG3IMB3S6IW3,Smart Apps Selection King!,"The S5100 was selected for it's wide variety of built in internet apps.  I did not realize just how MANY were built in.  This unit has performed beautifully and has filled the gap between OTA and Internet.  The Blu-Ray performs exceptionally well.  If I had any complaint, it would be the way it checks in to the internet when you access the apps.  Small potatoes.  Overall design, function, performance are top notch."
A3V8VZF9K8PRYE,A Wonderful Device,"I used to think that the iPad was better than the iPad mini but I was wrong. This device, even though it's small,  can do everything a computer can do. It has bright colors and the graphics are really nice so when my brother is playing minecraft , the screen is super clear and the buttons are easy to use {unlike a real phone it is hard to text}. When I listen to itunes or Pandora, the music sounds super clear without the headphones{unlike the iPod}. Also the iPad mini is super light so I can hold it in one hand and my hand won't get tired. When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load.There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception. Overall this is a great device and I highly recommend.- Olivia"
A2KMV056844YV2,Great Screen Protector for my IPad,"I just received the am Film Premium clear screen protector for my Apple iPad2 . The instructions clear and It was very easy to install. I choose the &#34;hinge&#34; method and it worked beautifully. I was able to attach the screen protector the first try with very few small bubbles, which were easily removed with the enclosed card. I have had my iPad2 for one week and was worried about scratches and smudges on the screen. This am Film Premium Screen Protector works perfectly for my iPad2. This installation was so much easier than trying to install a screen protector on my iPod or my Kindle. I highly recommend this am Film Premium Screen Protector for  the Apple iPad2. It is not for the iPad Air or iPad 5."
A2JR10TRIJXJ3R,A Real Photographer's Tool,"The V-lux does many things right, and the disadvantages are minor.After spending an hour with the camera in my living room this evening, I am very impressed with how well it is designed for convenient use. Although the camera manual is over 100 pages long, I only had to check it two times to access all of the needed photographic controls. The lens zoom is controlled by a smoothly rotating mechanical ring, just like an SLR zoom lens. Autofocus, macro focus, and manual focus are switched with an easily accessible switch on lens barrel. There's also a focus button right below that switch to engage the autofocus even when in manual mode. This is terrifically useful.All of the common settings are quickly accessible through the function button, and no matter what you're doing with settings or picture review, partially pressing the shutter release returns instantly to shooting mode. Again, it's very well thought out as a photographer's tool.The image stabilization is very effective. I was able to hand hold shots in my living room at 1/5 of a second with little evident camera shake in the photograph. Of course it cannot overcome all shaking, and not all photos were free of some blur from shaking, but I was very pleased with the improvement.The lens is remarkable. If you've ever used a 12x zoom on an SLR (like one of those Tamron or Sigma zooms) you might not expect much from such a lens design. Leica have lived up to their reputation, however, with this lens. It provides sharp, contrasty images with very little curvature of field (slight at the widest angle and gone quickly as you zoom in). There is no evident vignetting.The body of the camera is sturdy with an actual, solid door over the connectors (not one of those flimsy pieces of rubber found on most cameras). The camera balances well, and with a hand under the lens for support it's easy to hold steady. The lens barrel is metal, and the provided lens hood fits securely (with the lens cap still useable while the hood is in place).The fact that the LCD screen swivels down rather than to the side is another very well thought out design that is uncommon. The LCD screen remains more centered on the body when it's folded down, encouraging a more stable hold on the camera. It also more easily allows shooting from the waist than cameras with screens that fold out to the side. This can make it more easy to take candid photos, for example.The two most common negative comments about the V-lux 1 are that the photos can be noisy and lose detail at ISO above 200, and that there is no reason to pay more for the Leica version of the camera compared to the Panasonic version (FZ-50).The images taken above ISO 200 are better than I expected from the reviews, and the issue is really no different for other digital cameras with small sensors (e.g. almost everything that is not a full-sized SLR). The image sabilizer, however, allows using a lower, less noisy ISO in many situations when one would otherwise turn up the ISO. Also, it's important to remember that the online reviews tend to concentrate on the full-size appearance of photographs on screen. The actual printed photographs will look much better. If you really need noise-free images at high ISO then you'll get a full SLR. The V-lux is not trying to compete with that niche use. For taking indoor shots at family dinners for printing at normal sizes (up to 8x10, for example), the noise at higher ISO shouldn't be a big concern in my view. When I used film cameras (a Leica M6 for many years), I shot more than 80% of my photographs on ISO 100 slide film. The V-lux 1 provides excellent results at ISO 100 (essentially identical to a full SLR by objective measurement), and a lot more control and versatility than my old M6 (a traditional mechanical rangefinder camera with seriously good Leica lenses).The other criticism made in reviews is that the Panasonic version is less expensive for the same camera. They certainly share the same lens and body, but Leica has adjusted the image processing to provide more smooth jpeg images, use less aggressive noise reduction (to retain more detail at ISO above 200), and to match the color and contrast characteristics of traditional film shot with Leica cameras. I miss the color palette of Leica lenses that I used to see in my photographs with my Leica M6, and I'm very glad that the V-lux is tuned to provide that. To me, this is a significant advantage since the rich but not cartoonish or unatural Leica color rendition is unique and beautiful. In addition, Leica includes an SD card that holds about 80 photographs at maximum resolution. I'll get a 2Gb card, but this is a very useable backup.All in all I'm extremely pleased. The V-lux 1 is a real photographer's tool capable of producing results like a full SLR in over 80% of the situations that I would encounter. And in the other 20% it still performs quite well (as well as any non-SLR digital camera) for modest-sized prints and for use online and in e-mail. The tradeoffs, in my view, are minor.Addendum: I just got the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 20 case and the camera fits perfectly inside (I don't use the camera strap). The top is a bit stiff, but otherwise the case has a soft interior, an unobtrusive storage flap for extra memory cards, and is about the most compact case there is for the camera (it seems comparable to the much more expensive Leica case)."
A3J7LL0YR9P2GZ,Works really well!,"I love the design, the ease of use with this product. What was also amazing is that the company contacted me upon shipping the product and invited me to contact them if I needed assistance. That was really nice and surprising. I felt that they went an extra step in customer service.Now on to the product. I've read other reviews and people have said that the cord is too short, I agree however it works wonderfully with the charging cord which is a bit longer. The beauty of this is that you can charge while you use this product. The battery last a long time. It comes with a nice little case for the cords, I love that it has the ability to daisy chain which is a nice feature.Would definitely recommend."
A3BX5B14VB7ICN,My husband's second,"This is the second one of these my husband has ordered. The first one held up for a couple of years and then somehow got a bubble under the protector, so it's time to replace. This is overall the perfect screen protector!"
A3I9GLO19EX6JF,"Best small mp3 player, for the price.","This mp3 player m230, is small in memory capacity, but would hold enuf songs 4 to make u feel ok. If u want an inexpensive mp3 player, that could hold 120 songs, this is the best buy, on the market. Definitely recommended."
A1LYWR05FB4F8F,RETURNING THIS IMMEDIATELY,I received my product ontime and i was so excited but when i opened my package i was immediately taken aback by the odor. The case gives off a terrible nauseating smell. Instant head ache! It smells like paint  remover. Very disappointed.
AM98Q9ZDBE0C6,Canon 40mm Pancake Lens,"For $149 as an advanced hobbyist, I took a risk that this Canon pancake lens was worth the time and effort.  It is a great value.  My preference is Canon L glass for my 5DMII.  I own the 24-70 mm L & have been looking at acquiring a Canon L prime lens given the general consensus that they produce better quality images because there aren't as many elements as with zoom lenses, but L glass is very expensive.  It doesn't hurt the budget to be open minded and the reviews for this lens are all nearly five stars.  While 40mm was not my preference - I was looking at either the 50mm f 1.2 or the 35 mm f1.4 - what swayed me to give it a try was the small, compact design to be unobtrusive for street photography or to get that candid photo.  I take my 5DMII everywhere and at times the 24-70 lens can intimidate at the worse or draw unwanted attention at the least.  The pancake lens is not only unobtrusive, people seem to welcome having their photos taken when it is mounted on the 5DMII.  The lens did not fail to please in every regard.  At f 2.8, it is plenty fast (I prefer available light & go without a flash).  I am hard pressed to distinguish any drop in quality from the images taken with the 24-70 mm (but note that this a subjective eye-ball comparison, not charts and controlled conditions).  I am primarily interested in still photography but do dabble with the video capabilities of the 5DMII and this lens was also a very good video performer.  The 5DMII has a terrible microphone compared to its video quality, so I use a Rode mic when audio is important and therefore did not let the negative comments about the sound of the auto-focus motor used by this lens as noted by other reviews dissuade me, but I find that it is hardly noticeable even without the Rode mic.  This lens is small, inexpensive, easy to carry and produces very good images; I'll likely carry it with me even after I get one or more Canon L prime lenses."
A1QVJTZSZ1HBA,LG Slow in Keeping Promises,"I initially was going to buy another LG Blue Ray player; however, I saw the note that a newer version was available.  The newer version did not have the Amazon Instant Video feature in its software, a feature that I wanted.  I called LG and was told that a software update would be released on 16 Apr 2013 that would include Amazon Instant Video, not to worry.  It is now 6 May 2013, and the software update has still not been released.  About a week ago, I emailed the LG CEO in Japan.  I got a read receipt back; however, no other response has been forthcoming."
A1BIC919AYK4RJ,Functional...what else you need?,"Twelve South has created a great product to free up space on your desk from external hard drives.  The backpack is not much to look at, but it can support a 1TB Western Digital HD on the back.No instructions appeared to be included in the packaging so I had to take a few seconds to figure out how it all goes together.  There are a few sets of plastic tab/clamps that fit into the back of the rack to mount to the monitor stand of the iMac.  The clamps are numbered denoting some difference in size; however, I don't know what it is.  Each one seems to fit after tightening the bolts down.I wish the stand was built a little sturdier on thicker aluminum because the weight of the 1TB drive makes the backpack bend.  I always fear that the drive could tip over and fall down behind the desk after a small bump, especially while it's reading or writing.  Living in earthquake country, CA doesn't help with my fear of tipping over."
A3M8WLG9KXJB8S,I Dig It,"I bought this little guy to replace a 6th Gen iPad Nano. My main complaints about the Nano:1. No buttons, difficult to work with it when you are running or working out. Difficult to pause when a co-worker arrives at your desk.2. I'm a Linux guy. The 6th gen iPod nano is not compatible with any Linux drivers. Will not work with gtk-pod. Running a VM just for an iPod is a drag.3. You're stuck with the storage size you buy.Don't get me wrong, I really did like the Nano, but for my usage patterns it was not ideal. The Zip Clip takes care of the above problems and then some.1. Buttons are easy to find and navigate, even when you are not using your eyes.2. You can load it just using your raw MP3's or MTP mode using Rhythmbox on Linux, and lots of other music managers on other platforms.3. Stick a microSD card in it and bam, you now have a 36 GB portable music player.4. Bonus, the Zip Clip has a custom EQ mode as well as presets, so you can make your music sound just the way you want.5. Bonus, the Zip Clip supports the leveling encoded in your MP3's or albums. Yes, the iPod has sound check but that's all secret voodoo stuff and only works with their own files.The size is a bit bigger than the nano but it's made of plastic and is nearly the same weight (Zip Clip is 25 grams, nano is 20.) I clip it on my watchband when I'm working out. It also dangles from my lanyard when I'm working. My RSA fob and badge weigh way more than the Zip Clip.I'm really happy with this thing, it does exactly what I want it to do. Dealing with the iPod was becoming rather frustrating to a non-Apple guy and I find that the Zip Clip has a couple added features that make it work and sound better than the iPod. Me like."
A20Y7WEQKB8CPG,A bit tackier than what I would like,"Nothing extreme on the tackiness (in the true meaning of the word not they typical usage of gaudy, flashy, or showy.) but you simply have to learn the proper amount of pressure to use on the screen again. I selected this product over other because of their warranty. The dollar options looked the same but if this doesn't stay stuck or doesn't resist some basic scratches, you are not protected."
A20WUW45LIX63G,Handy,Handy plug in charger that will accept up to four usb connections for charging multiple items. Delivery was exceptional and met expectations..
A3NBVQSKUYD96P,"Finally, something that works for my cordless phone","This is try number 5 to find a headset that would work with my Panasonic cordless phone.  There are other very good headsets, but they had a stereo connection (plus mic).  My phone works with a monaural connection (took me 4 headsets to work this out).  This set is great!  My voice is clear (no echoing) and loud.  This is a great buy!"
A1N354AYAGG6LQ,Wonderful!,I bought this because of the no bubble guarantee and have been extremely pleased. NO BUBBLES and super easy to put on. I have experienced no difficulties whatsoever with the responsiveness of the screen. It's easy to clean and as close to invisible as you could want. I only wish they would make one for my Nexus 10!
A27VAV8WFLJ68,Perfect,I'm no expert but it's significantly faster than my old low-dollar switch.
A3GSHMJ7KG4UBS,Good replacement battery for Olympus camera,"I bought this battery to replace the original battery in my Olympus SP700 camera.  It is fully compatible, and getting 2 at this price is a nice bonus: now I have a back-up battery too."
A3LIVI9S6ZOFVU,absolutely love this product,"this product arrived very quickly, was really easy to put together with the instructions included, and worked perfectly for my needs. With the included hardware, you could pretty much match up to any projector you have."
A1QMARDM7M9NNR,solid product,"First of all, you need to decide if you really need a tablet, because if you don't, you can find laptops smaller, lighter, brighter, and possibly cheaper.But if you want a tablet, this one is a very strong contender. Current price ($850 in Circuit City) is simply the best in this category.It's pretty small and lightweight (4.6 lb) and has removable DVD drive if you want to travel lighter. It's size and weight is not unlike other laptops in 12 - 13"" category. It's not ultraportable. Neither it costs as much as ultraportable.It's standard battery is pretty small, running for 2-3 hours depending on use. One can buy heavier extended 9 cell battery. Battery is slightly protruding and can be used as a tablet handle.This laptop is not a slouch, it measured 196 in Scimark test. Compared to 5 year old 2GHz dual Athlon desktop, this laptop is 15% faster in mixed tests. Combined with 3GB memory, this laptop can run pretty much anything on Vista, except for the most demanding games. Microsoft gives it rating 3.6, which is pretty good (typical range for laptops 3.3-3.8). Some people like Vista, some don't. I think Vista is great, more stable and secure than XP, though eats more memory, which isn't a problem here. If you don't like Vista, don't buy this laptop, you will have hard time installing other OS.It does have a variable speed fan and produces some heat, not much, unless it runs on full power - comparable to other similar performing laptops. Fan is quiet, unless runs on full power. So you probably don't want to use this laptop as a server, running heavy applications all the time. Neither you would want any laptop for that matter.Watching DVD runs at around 40-50% of CPU frequency, the noise from fan and DVD drive are practically undetectable.In a tablet mode you can rotate the screen in horizontal or vertical position. The second is absolutely great for reading PDF documents.You can easily connect an external monitor (only VGA connector available), it works at least upto 1600x1200, maybe more.After starting Windows, be prepared to load a huge number of updates (100 or so). It took hours and laptop has frozen couple times during this process.OneNote that comes with this laptop works great with pen. It can save handwriting and search for it! This laptop has one of the best handwriting recognition software I've ever seen. So you can use it in tablet mode all the time.Wireless 802.11b/g/n connection is stable. Vista is very nice connecting to the network, so you shouldn't have any problems.On the negative side, this laptop is manufactured in China, and there are plenty of refurbished units for sale, which is an indicator that it can lack reliability."
A3DO87D9VNGGWD,Awesome fit,"Zeikos filters were a perfect fit on my T3. Though i've yet to master my photography skills, I've suggested these to many of my friends. You won't be disappointed."
A4OPNK2K0EDLG,Growing on Me,"We have an iPad, an iPad2, and the Xoom. They are 3 different experiences, but the iPads are mostly about thinner, lighter, and maybe faster (iPad2 only). The Xoom does not FEEL slower, but it is definitely heavier than the iPad2. That said, who sits and hold a tablet in their hands for more than a minute? Some have criticized the screen for color washout. I went to the same browswer page on all 3 of our tablets and discovered that the iPads are over-boosted for color. So skin tone, for instance, is more accurate on the Xoom. In addition, the Xoom has a light sensor that dims the screen in a dark room so the glare is reduced. Nice feature...maybe that's why some thought the screen was washed out. Compared to the iPads, the Xoom is more complicated. If you're familiar with Android, you probably won't have much of a problem, but otherwise, you'll experience a lot of frustration--I use a tons of tech, and I did--without a manual. Luckily, a manual is easy to find and cheap or free. I got mine from the Kindle store. The Xoom experience is really more for people who like tech and like to control their device's environment, in my opinion, while the iPad is more about ""turn it on and go."" If you're heavily into streaming movies or vids from Amazon or a competitor, go with the Xoom because the use of the screen's space is superior. The tablet war will be won with apps, eventually, and Android and others are lagging because developers can't make their return on investment yet, but give it a half year or so and Andriod's Honeycomb will be competitive, though still behind Apple, I believe. My final comment is that I would always want an iPad AND a Honeycomb tablet. There might be a better version than the Xoom here or coming, but really check the feature set, and make sure it's a fair comparison: are you getting the same memory and 4G connectivity for the price, for instance? Do both have usb, hdmi, mini SD card slot, etc? In the end, I really like the Xoom, despite having to work at it...but I'll also be buying an iPad 3 when it comes out.Pros:4G coming, Great feature set (far superior to the iPad), Versatility, Quick, Solid build quality, True multi-tasking, More user controlCons:Can be over-priced (so shop), A few features still not available, Needs a manual, Heavy, Plenty of Apps, but needs to double down.Best Uses:Browsing, Games, Music, Email, Photos, Research, Productivity (beats Apple here), Reading, Etc."
A2YM5C4HPMKOD6,Decent laptop,"Worked fine for the last 6 months. Battery life is still about the same, which is not great but ok. Keyboard feels fine. Wish it was a sturdier case. A short drop off a bed onto carpet cracked screen. Replacement was quick and easy though. A good laptop if you aren't looking for serious gaming or graphics."
A3M46XGLMI9OQS,Not bad,"Aside from the picture being inaccurately colored (came as black only), these pads are nice and do exactly as I'd hoped they would."
A2ASOTSR38IEXQ,HP PAVILION TX 2510US,"I purchased the Tablet PC about a month back and am getting toknow the various features.It is of course light especially when compared to my previous 17 inch HP pavilion dv8213cl .The handwriting recognition is very good and i believe it is supposed to get better with time.The display especially when viewing photos is not as crisp as with my bigger laptop.The battery life leaves a little to be desired and i might have to go with the six or eight cell battery to improve usage time.Other than that i have no complaints so far.It is reasonably priced and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.HP Pavilion TX2510US 12.1-inch Laptop (2.10 GHz  AMD Turion X2 ZM-80 Processor, 3 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium) Black"
A91K91GJRE6OU,Simple Product - Solid Delivery,"It's a cheap tool to have in the tool kit, but an important one. Solid construction, and cheap price. Can't go wrong!"
A20NYHD5EKSKZV,The price is incredible,"These stylus pens work wonderfully.  I gave one to my daughter, a friend and kept one for myself.  I will order more when needed but still using the one I purchased several months ago.  These stylus pens keep your screen nice and clean.  Just lightly run pen across the screen to work.  The price was incredible.  I thought it was a scam and took a chance and ordered them.  I received the pens pretty quick and they were brand new.  I will definitely purchase more when needed."
ANXW0MIMZLFAQ,Love this flash!,"I absolutely love the fact that a flash is now powered by a li-ion battery! I have shot around 4000 shots with my tt850's. I own 2 flashes and 3 batteries. I can get about 1300 shots out of one battery. And that is a mix of full power, half and 1/8th power shots. They seem to last forever and I love how fast the flash recycles! Amazing! The triggers work awesome as well and you should check out my review on them.When I first received my first TT850, I was very impressed with the solid build quality, and how awesome the flash was with the battery and everything. Sure its a tiny bit bigger than the yn-568's and the Canon 580EX II's that I own(ed) but its hardly noticeable and the battery and its amazing life and power more than makes up for this! I read that someone was upset that you couldn't add an additional battery pack. You don't need it! They seem to last forever and recycle super fast all the way to the very end of the battery. By an extra battery or two. for less than 200 bucks, you could have the flash and 3 batteries and be able to shoot 1950 shots at full power!! That is crazy! Simply amazing! I will for sure pick up the V860c when its available in the next few weeks. I'm anxious to give it a try, but I'm sure it won't let me down."
A2QP1PWPGJU2ST,The new way to carry music,"This is the perfect product to carry the music to plug into the USB ports of your car stereo. They practically disappear once in the socket. I rip my CDs to WAV files because I prefer the sound to compressed music files but they take up a lot of space. Flash memory is now so low in price I can have several 16 GB drives and carry a lot of music with me. 16 GB seems about the perfect size for WAV files, lots of songs but not so many that it takes a long time to load and to search through. Been using SanDisk memory for many years and have always been happy with the product."
AAWXL12IG75OS,Not as shown but works,"The picture of this battery clearly shows this is a 1500Mah battery, but what is sent is a 1050Mah. It did come fully charged and when tested in my SX30IS it was able to record about 90 minutes of HD video plus a few pics on a charge. Why the need to advertise more than they deliver is a mystery."
ADW7HM89VDFAV,good price,I got this to use with new Canon digital camera for storage. It does what I needed it to do
A3QGWSRO10WN62,Great keyboard,"Keys feel great to type on, and the lighting of the keys make keys crystal clear when no lights are on."
A2QBHP6CKC8QDS,Toshiba HD-A35 1080p HD DVD Player,"This is a great piece of equipment for the money. However, it appears that HD-DVD may be a thing of the past. The recent endorsement of more movie houses to drop HD-DVD and add Blu-Ray as their format of choice may spell the end for HD-DVD. Until then, Toshiba is the way to go."
A1IFRE5YV9RCQX,Could not get it to work,"I ended up returning this extender and getting the Securifi Almond router/extender.  I never got the Netgear to work properly while being MAC address filtered.  Then I learned that I could extend my wireless signal by cascading two routers together, which is what I have done since I have the house ethernet wiring to do that.  One glitch with cascading so far has been that my computer and printer won't talk when connected to the second router.  Solution--connect both to the primary router.  Oh, and customer support was awful with Netgear.  Dropped calls, no return calls, hours of my life I'll never get back."
A2993YNOT7WTKB,easy connection to Netflix later poor wifi,"As many others have done, I stewed on this player for two generations, waiting for the internet/Netflix issues to be addressed or at least become less frequently complained about.I purchased this player at Costco a few days ago and had it set up in a few minutes,  The menu graphics are razor sharp and nice, and I was able to set up and connect to Netflix wirelessly in about three minutes.  I also did the firmware per the popup suggestion on the menu -- that seems to have been no problem, either.  Perhaps I was lucky -- I feel relieved and lucky. I am using simple WEP security due to a Vizio TV which must have this for wi fi to work.  The player is fast loading and the picture is brilliant so far.Note that his player has an optical output for digital audio hookup to my older receiver without HDMI inputs.  This was important for me. I will update if any problems arise with this player.UPDATE JUNE 2013:  I have not been able to connect to my wifi network for a few months now despite multiple attempts. The player will read one bar of signal although other wifi devices get 3 bars and full connectivity.  Repostioning the player makes no difference.  This is a great player but worthless streaming device."
A3DCNXW58CWJW5,Just what we were looking for,My husband loved this case so much it really protects his ipod.  I just reordered one for my son. I may need to order two more!  One for everyone!
A19BNIKGZS8RGV,Sigma AF 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS Zoom Lens for Nikon D40,"UPDATE: This lens ceased functioning 14 months after I bought it.  The local repair shop could not fix it, and said it needed to go back to Sigma.  Minimum repair price was $125, and likely higher than $150.  Plus shipping.  I changed my rating from 4 stars to 1 star because of this.  I replaced it with a Nikon 28-200 that has been quite satisfactory, though I occasionally miss the extra wide reach of the Sigma.  Call me an unhappy Sigma customer.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have used this lens with my D40 for about a month.  I was concerned about the relative slowness of the lens, especially at full zoom, but the OS makes up for it allowing me to shoot successfully at slower shutter speeds.  Optically the lens seems fine to me.  It DOES autofocus with the D40.  Combined with a Sigma 30mm HSM prime lens, I have everything I need for most situations.  This lens is significantly larger and heavier than the Nikon kit lenses.  You will know that you have this 1-lb lens hanging around your neck!  I am very satisfied with this lens.  Recommended to replace both the 18-55 and 55-200 Nikon kit lenses."
ALBFYA60SMZQ5,Its a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem,Based on the features this model has and great reviews I decided to buy it. I've been running this cable modem 24/7 for nearly a month now without a problem. You can have it standing on its side or laying flat. Either way it gets plenty of ventilation to keep it cool. Because of the DOCSIS 3.0 this modem has the potential to achieve higher speeds. The small footprint allows you to put it pratically anywhere. There are also two different colored link lights. Orange for 100mb and blue for 1000mb. All the other lights are green.
A36QAGLUPBBV3F,A mouse for those that work on the bed!,"I'll admit it. Contrary to all the usual advise, I do a significant amount of my work from the bed. And I hadn't been able to find a mouse that worked well on any soft surface (be it the sheets, a pillow or any other bed surface) but I decided to give this one a try since it seemed to be specifically designed for this purpose.What a fantastic mouse this is!It works perfectly in the bed, in a pillow, in my pants or on top of any other surface I want to throw at it. Yes, even a bunch of crumpled pillow covers will do. It is accurate, responsive and uniform in all surfaces.Ergonomics are good and the buttons feel just right. The weel is exceptional, and can switch from notchy to free rolling with just one press.Only downside I found is that the dongle is slightly larger than I would like. It is pretty small but the small protruding boxy shape gets often stuck when I pack my laptop in my backpack.Of course, if it was bluetooth I would have been able to do without the dongle altogether, but my experience with BT mice has been consistently bad (with lots of lag and high power consumption) so I guess the technology itself doesn't lend itself for a good mouse experience.But other than the slightly boxy dongle that could be made a bit smoother and smaller, I have nothing bad to say about this mouse. I really love it and most couch potatos will love it as well."
